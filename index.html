For once, it sounded like Daddy was proud of him. Mama leaned close to his ear. </p> <p> "Go ahead. All you have to do is tell what you heard, just like we practiced this morning at the kitchen table. Your daddy is counting on you." </p> <p> "But Mama--" </p> <p> "Mr. Mitchell, are you intending to call your son as a witness in this case?" the judge asked. </p> <p> Mr. Laney jumped to his feet. His freckled, round face flushed bright red, and his voice rose in protest. </p> <p> "Your Honor, I discussed this with Mr. Mitchell as soon as I received his list of potential witnesses. This is highly improper. His son is mentally limited and not able to provide competent testimony. Parading him in front of the jury is inflammatory, prejudicial, and inherently unreliable!" </p> <p> Tall, with light brown hair and dark, piercing eyes, Daddy responded smoothly. </p> <p> "Judge Robinson, I believe the district attorney misstates the legal standard for competency to testify in the state of Georgia. It is whether a witness understands the nature of a judicial oath. Age and intelligence are not the final arbiters of the capacity to offer probative testimony. That determination rests with the Court, and I'm prepared to lay the foundation necessary for this witness to testify. The fact that he's my son is irrelevant." </p> <p> Mr. Robinson removed the pen clenched between his teeth and peered over the edge of the bench at Jimmy. The young boy stared back through thick glasses held in place by large ears. Jimmy shared the same hair color as his father, but his eyes, like those of his birth mother, were pale blue. Average in height for a sixth grader at Piney Grove Elementary School, Jimmy ran his finger inside the collar of his shirt and pulled at the tie around his neck. </p> <p> "How old is he?" the judge asked. </p> <p> "Twelve, but he'll be thirteen in a few weeks," Daddy replied. </p> <p> "His chronological age is not an indicator of his mental capacity," Mr. Laney responded quickly. "We're not dealing with a normal--" </p> <p> "Gentlemen," the judge interrupted. "We'll take up the competency determination outside the presence of the jury. Bailiff, escort the jurors to the jury room." </p> <p> Jimmy watched as the people sitting in chairs on the other side of his daddy left the courtroom. One black-haired woman wearing a cobalt-blue dress looked at him and smiled. </p> <p> Pointing in her direction, he whispered to Mama, "Does that lady in the blue dress know me?" </p> <p> "That's Mrs. Murdock. She's a teacher at the high school." </p> <p> "I hope I'm in her class when I go to high school. She looks nice. What does she teach?" </p> <p> "She teaches English." </p> <p> "Oh," Jimmy said, disappointed. "I already know English." </p> <p> As soon as the last person left and the bailiff closed the door, Mr. Robinson spoke. </p> <p> "Mr. Mitchell, proceed with your evidence as to the competency of this young man to testify." </p> <p> Jimmy watched Daddy pick up a legal pad and turn to a new page. </p> <p> "Admittedly, Your Honor, Jimmy is mentally limited. However, that doesn't automatically eliminate his capability to offer testimony with probative value in this case." </p> <p> "What kind of testimony?" Mr. Laney asked. "The defendant is charged with felony possession and intent to distribute over two pounds of cocaine. To bring in an impressionable child who can be manipulated in an effort to distract the jury--" </p> <p> "Don't jump ahead, Mr. Laney," the judge interrupted. "That goes to the weight assigned to his testimony, not the competency issue. We're going to take everything in proper order, and you'll have ample opportunity to raise your objections." </p> <p> Mr. Laney, his face still red, sat. Jimmy poked his mama's arm. </p> <p> "Is Mr. Laney mad at Daddy?" </p> <p> "Not really. They'll still play golf on Saturday, but he doesn't want you to tell what you heard." </p> <p> "Why not?" </p> <p> "He's doing his job." </p> <p> That didn't make sense, but Jimmy could tell that Mama didn't want to talk. He looked at the man sitting at the table beside Daddy. His name was Jake Garner, and Daddy was his lawyer. Garner had long black hair and a very realistic drawing of a blue-and-red snake on his arm. The tail began at the man's elbow and coiled around his arm before disappearing under his shirt. Jimmy stared at the drawing and wished Jake would roll up his sleeve so he could see the snake's head. Jimmy wasn't afraid of snakes; he'd seen several while walking in the woods with Grandpa. He knew not to pet them or pick them up. </p> <p> "Mama," he said in a whisper. "Will that drawing of a snake on Jake's arm wash off in the shower?" </p> <p> "No," she answered. "It's a tattoo. It's permanent." </p> <p> Jimmy thought a moment. "Could I get a tattoo of Buster on my arm?" </p> <p> "No. Hush." </p> <p> Mama turned toward Daddy. Jimmy scooted back against the wooden bench and sat on his hands. He'd never talked to Jake Garner and didn't know about cocaine. But he knew what he'd heard Sheriff Brinson say to Detective Milligan. </p> <p> Daddy kept talking. "Before asking Jimmy any questions, I thought it would be beneficial to offer expert-opinion testimony from a psychologist who has evaluated him. I'd prefer that both the jury and the Court hear this testimony." </p> <p> The judge shook his head. "That's not necessary, Mr. Mitchell. Whether this young man is competent to testify is for me to decide. Proceed." </p> <p> Daddy stepped back. "Perhaps you'll reconsider after you hear what the psychologist has to say. The defense calls Dr. Susan Paris to the stand." </p> <p> Jimmy hadn't seen the psychologist with blond hair and bright red fingernails slip into the courtroom. He turned around and saw her sitting beside Sheriff Brinson. </p> <p> When Jimmy first met Dr. Paris, he was shy around her, but after she fixed vanilla wafers with peanut butter on them, they'd gotten along fine. She gave him a test at the beginning of each school year. Jimmy's friend Max told him that tests should be given at the end of the school year to find out what a student learned, not in September to find out what had been forgotten over the summer. But Jimmy didn't argue with Dr. Paris. Eating perfectly prepared vanilla wafers with peanut butter was a small price to pay for having to fill in little circles with a number-two pencil. </p> <p> Dr. Paris walked to the witness stand. When she passed Jimmy, he glanced down at her hands. Her fingernails were so red they looked wet. She took the witness stand and raised her hand. She looked calm and pretty. </p> <p> "I do," she said after the judge asked her a question with God's name at the end of it. </p> <p> The psychologist reached into her purse, and Jimmy entertained a hopeful thought that she'd brought some vanilla wafers into the courtroom. But all she did was take out a tissue. </p> <p> "Please state your name," Daddy said. </p> <p> "Dr. Susan Elaine Paris." </p> <p> "What is your profession?" </p> <p> "I work part-time as a school psychologist for the Cattaloochie County Board of Education and maintain a private practice focused on children and adolescents here in Piney Grove." </p> <p> "Please outline your educational and professional qualifications." </p> <p> "I received a BS in psychology from the University of Virginia, and I earned a master's and doctorate in clinical psychology from Vanderbilt University." </p> <p> "Are you licensed to practice child and adolescent psychology in the state of Georgia?" </p> <p> "Yes." </p> <p> "How long have you been licensed?" </p> <p> "Five years." </p> <p> Daddy paused. "Your Honor, we tender Dr. Paris as an expert in the field of child psychology." </p> <p> "No objection," Mr. Laney said. </p> <p> "Proceed," the judge said. </p> <p> "Dr. Paris, have you had the opportunity to evaluate my son, Jimmy Mitchell?" </p> <p> "Yes, as part of my regular duties for the school system, I give Jimmy a battery of tests each fall to determine his status and help formulate an educational plan for the teachers working with him. I also have access to the evaluations conducted by Dr. Kittle, my predecessor." </p> <p> Jimmy had forgotten Dr. Kittle's name. She had white hair and didn't paint her fingernails at all. Jimmy leaned close to Mama. </p> <p> "What happened to Dr. Kittle?" he whispered. </p> <p> "She retired and moved to the beach." </p> <p> Jimmy liked the beach but not the ocean. Even small waves terrified him. </p> <p> "Can you summarize Jimmy's general mental status?" Daddy asked. </p> <p> "Yes. He has below-average general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive capability. Age-appropriate IQ testing has consistently revealed a verbal, performance, and full-scale IQ in the 68 to 70 range. An IQ score less than 59 indicates a severe deficit. Over 70 is dull-normal. Thus, Jimmy is in between mental retardation and the dull-normal category." </p> <p> Jimmy squirmed in his seat. He didn't understand everything the psychologist was saying, but he recognized the word <em>retardation</em>. Mean people used that word when they talked about him. </p> <p> "Where is he placed within the school system?" Daddy asked. </p> <p> "Jimmy does not have any abnormal behavioral problems and, pursuant to the school board's inclusion policy, is integrated into a regular classroom. His teachers utilize nonstandard testing to monitor his progress, and I review the results on a monthly basis." </p> <p> "What can you tell the Court about Jimmy's current level of intellectual functioning?" </p> <p> "Once Jimmy grasps a concept, he is capable of retaining it. However, he faces a formidable challenge in appropriately applying what he's learned. The educational process can be frustrating to him, but he maintains a good attitude and has shown adequate progress." </p> <p> Mr. Laney stood. "Your Honor, this is a criminal trial, not a parent-teacher conference." </p> <p> "Move along, Mr. Mitchell," ...</p></p><h2>The Holocaust /anglais</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p><strong>Laurence Rees </strong>is a former head of BBC TV History programs and creative director of BBC Television History.

Rees' best book yet" <strong>-Andrew Roberts, author of <em>The Storm of War</em></strong></p><h2>Liberty and Equality: The American Conversation (American Political Thought)</h2><p>Alexis de Tocqueville, one of the greatest commentators on the American political tradition, viewed it through the lens of two related ideas: liberty and equality. These ideas, so eloquently framed by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence, have remained inextricably and uniquely conjoined in American political thought: equality is understood as the equal possession of natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. By considering American reflections on these core ideas over time&#x2014;in relation to constitutional principles, religion, and race&#x2014;this volume provides an especially insightful perspective for understanding our political tradition. The book is at once a summary of American history told through ideas and an inquiry into the ideas of liberty and equality through the lens of American history.<br><br>To a remarkable extent, American politics has always been thoughtful and American thought has always been political. In these pages, we see how some of our greatest minds have grappled with the issues of liberty and equality: Tocqueville and Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton as Publius in <i>The Federalist</i>, James Madison, George Washington, William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln debating Stephen Douglas, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. In essays responding to these primary sources, some of today's finest scholars take up topics critical to the American experiment in liberal democracy&#x2014;political inequality, federalism, the separation of powers, the relationship between religion and politics, the history of slavery and the legacy of racism. Together these essays and sources help to clarify the character, content, and significance of American political thought taken as a whole. They illuminate and continue the conversation that has animated and distinguished the American political tradition from the beginning&#x2014;and, hopefully, better equip readers to contribute to that conversation.</p><p>S. Adam Seagrave is assistant professor of political science at Northern Illinois University and managing editor of <i>American Political Thought</i>. He is the author of <i>The Foundations of Natural Morality: On the Compatibility of Natural Rights and the Natural Law.</i>A novel combination of primary sources and accessible essays, <i>Liberty and Equality</i> captures the unique blend of politics and philosophy at the heart of American Political Thought and situates it within the history of political philosophy.&#x2014;<b>George Thomas</b>, author of <i>The Founders and the Idea of a National University: Constituting the American Mind</i><p>By moving between primary documents and insightful contemporary interpretations, this volume gives readers a deep understanding of how the history of American political thought might illuminate an understanding of American politics today. This volume orients readers to the fundamentals of American constitutional democracy&#x2014;equality, civic virtue, federalism, separation of powers, religious liberty, slavery, and majority rule. Seagrave and his contributors convey a profound understanding of constitutional democracy in America: the intentions that underlie its most central institutions, the ideals these institutions are meant to reflect and serve, and the social facts that distinctively shape both the institutions and ideals.&#x2014;<b>Russell Muirhead</b>, Clements Professor of Democracy and Politics, Dartmouth College</p></p><h2>Souping: Lose Weight - Cleanse - Detoxify - Re-Energize; Over 80 Deliciously Healthy Reci</h2><p><p>A full-color cookbook with more than 80 healthy hot and cold soup recipes and cleanses for losing weight, detoxification, and revitalized health.</p><p><i>Souping</i> is a new way to cleanse the body.

Though she loved the spirituality the church provided, she knew that, because of sexism, homophobia, and manipulative religious politics, established religious institutions weren&#x2019;t always holy or safe. Instead of offering refuge, these institutions have betrayed people&#x2019;s hearts and souls. &#x201c;People have suffered religious abuse,&#x201d; she writes, &#x201c;which can be different from physical injury or psychological trauma.&#x201d;</p><p>Though participation and affiliation in traditional religious institutions is waning, many people still believe in God. Merritt contends that many leave the church because they have lost trust in the institution, not in God. <em>Healing Spiritual Wounds</em> addresses the church&#x2019;s dichotomous image&#x2014;as a safe space and as a dangerous place&#x2014;and provides a way to restore personal faith and connection to God for those who have been hurt or betrayed by established institutions of faith. Merritt lays out a multistage plan for moving from pain to spiritual rebirth, from recovering theological and emotional shards to recovering communal wholeness. </p><p>Merritt does not sugarcoat the wrongs institutions long seen as trustworthy have inflicted on many innocent victims. Sympathetic, understanding, and deeply positive, she offers hope and a way to help them heal and reclaim the spiritual joy that can make them whole again.</p></p><p>&#x201c;Merritt has done it again. <em>Healing Spiritual Wounds</em> shepherds me toward God. Merritt is the honest voice, the thoughtful voice, the inviting voice, the justice voice, the personable voice that my spirit has yearned to hear.

Hackenberg is the author of <i>Sacred Pause</i> and <i>Writing to God</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Merritt transfigures her own harrowing journey into wisdom for others. With the heart of a pastor and the skill of a healer, Merritt pairs moving testimony with thoughtful exercises for working through trauma. Courageous, cathartic, and deeply moving, this book is a balm for bruised believers.&#x201d; (Katherine Willis Pershey, author of <i>Any Day a Beautiful Change</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Carol Howard Merritt gently unspools the tightly wound messages of shame and guilt that strangle spirits and cause damage to body, soul and relationships.

Noted authority Christopher de Hamel invites the reader into intimate conversations with these texts to explore what they tell us about nearly a thousand years of medieval history - and about the modern world, too. <br><br> In so doing, de Hamel introduces us to kings, queens, saints, scribes, artists, librarians, thieves, dealers, and collectors. He traces the elaborate journeys that these exceptionally precious artifacts have made through time and shows us how they have been copied, how they have been embroiled in politics, how they have been regarded as objects of supreme beauty and as symbols of national identity, and who has owned them or lusted after them (and how we can tell).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> From the earliest book in medieval England to the incomparable Book of Kells to the oldest manuscript of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, these encounters tell a narrative of intellectual culture and art over the course of a millennium. &nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the manuscripts visited are now in libraries of North America, the Morgan Library in New York and the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.<br><br> Part travel book, part detective story, part conversation with the reader, <i>Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts&nbsp;</i>allows us to experience some of the greatest works of art in our culture to give us a different perspective on history and on how we come by knowledge.</p><p><b>Christopher de Hamel </b>is perhaps the best-known writer on medieval manuscripts in the world.&nbsp; In the course of a long career at Sotheby's he catalogued more illuminated manuscripts than any other person alive, and very possibly more than any one individual has ever done. Christopher de Hamel is a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge; he was until recently librarian of Parker Library in Cambridge, a collection which includes many, even most, of the earliest manuscripts in English language and history. De Hamel lives in London and Cambridge.&#x201c;<i>Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts&nbsp;</i>is one of the least likely and most wonderful books I have ever read. Least likely: Where to start? It&#x2019;s a vanishingly rare pleasure, given the commercial constraints of modern publishing, to handle 600 smoothly weighty pages in which the printed text winds its way seamlessly among more than 200 glorious, often full-color illustrations. And in producing such a gorgeous object, Christopher de Hamel&#x2019;s publisher has had the courage of his convictions, because its physical and visual delights mirror its commercially unlikely subject matter...[De Hamel] is voraciously completist, recording impressions of each journey, place, building and reading room, as well as every coverage detail of each manuscript&#x2019;s creation, content and existence as a physical object through time and space... On this archival odyssey, I lost count of the things I learned...[<i>Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts</i>], like the volumes that are its subject, is a book of wonders.&#x201d;&nbsp; -&nbsp;<i><b>The New York Times Book Review&nbsp;</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts</i> is miles away from academic dry-as-dust scholarship.

Few know this better than Haris Dimitriadis, an ex-corporate climber who one day realized that, although he had all the hallmarks of success&#x2014;money, a good job, the respect of his peers&#x2014;he wasn&#x2019;t happy. In fact, he felt hollow, dissatisfied, and anxious. Thankfully, he discovered Epicurus.In this pioneering thinker, Dimitriadis found a teacher whose ideas seemed specifically designed to cure our uniquely modern ache. Indeed, few classical philosophers remain as relevant and practical today; Epicurus&#x2019; worldview is rooted in our senses, feelings, and natural dispositions. Sweeping aside our modern assumption that the acquisition of happiness is necessarily painful and regimented&#x2014;think of our love for strict workouts, diets, hard work, and other ascetic practices&#x2014;Epicurus declared that finding happiness is easy: we simply need to embrace our natural desires. With wit, rigor, and in simple, easy-to-understand language, Epicurus and the Pleasant Life joyfully brings Epicurus singing into the twenty-first century. Leading the reader through the worlds of philosophy, religion, neuroscience, psychology, and astrophysics, Dimitriadis and Epicurus present a great, self-affirming truth: that you too can lead a blissfully happy life, if you only learn how to reach out and take it.Based on a worldview rooted in the reality of senses, feelings, natural dispositions, life experiences, and perceptions, this philosophy teaches us to trust our feelings, and use logic to make decisions only after we acknowledge our natural desires. That way, we will find our place in the natural world, and learn to live simply and joyfully in the company of good friends.Join the author Haris Dimitriadis on a journey through the history of philosophical and religious thought, as well as an in-depth look at the modern neuroscience, psychology, and astrophysics, and discover why the ancient Epicurean Philosophy of Nature matters as much today as it did two thousand and three hundred years ago! The answers you will find may surprise you, for you will learn, beyond any doubt, that you, too, hold the power of self-transformation, and a blissfully happy life.</p><p>It is with a joyful heart and deep sense of responsibility that I offer the learnings in this book. I propose that you can live the pleasant life if you so choose.This book is a labor of love, a vehicle by which to share my personal experience with you. Despite its technocratic nature, it is undeniably a deposition of my soul, brimming with emotion, pleasure and pain throughout my quest for joy. I am pleased to present an empirically sound, well documented philosophy of life, which serves as a refreshing alternative to the prevailing idealistic culture.Neither fate nor fortune cast a shadow upon your life without your permission. But worry not as you are inherently well equipped for this journey to the joyful life. With determination and perseverance, you too will find the happiness to which you are entitled. You need only take the first step. Open your mind and activate your will to take your life in your hands by pursuing pleasure.CHAPTER 1OVERVIEW&#34;The secret of happiness is in the diathesis (disposition) of which we are sole arbiters.&#34;Epicurean follower, Diogenes of OenoandaOf all the philosophers to ever walk the golden grounds of ancient Greece, there was one man particularly worthy of notice. So notable was his work that even now, two thousand three hundred years later, his philosophy is one that lingers in the social fabric of man. It is safe to say that it will continue to do so. His name was Epicurus, son of Neocles and Chaerestrate. His philosophy was that of a happy life based on the search for simple natural pleasures. One devoid of the help of religions, god, politics, consumerism, wealth, power, or fame. Epicurus argued that any man can acquire and maintain bodily health and peace of mind by using only his own natural powers.CHAPTER 24THE FEAR OF DEATH&#34;Death is nothing to us; for that which has been dissolved into its elements experiences no sensations, and that which has no sensation is nothing to us.&#34;Epicurus, Principal Doctrine IIOf all the fears that oppress humans, none compare to the fear of death. Its prospect causes panic attacks even to those who do not face an immediate danger of death. By instinct, we believe that we will continue to live forever. If we did not see people dying around us, we would never come to the realization of the existence of death. Reality makes us face it in order to provide a way out of the terror that is caused by the prospect of the end of life.The idealistic and religious approachesto deathSeeking an illusion to overcome death, people have sought legacy-by having children, for example, in order to live through their offspring.CHAPTER 30THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS IN MODERN LIFE&#34;The wise man who has become accustomed to necessitiesknows better how to share with others than how to take from them, so great a treasure of self-sufficiency has he found.&#34;Epicurus, Vatican Saying XLIVThe philosophy of Epicurus is psychological. It is the counterpart to medicine. As medicine is worthwhile so long as it expels the diseases of the body, so is philosophy worthwhile as long as it expels the maladies of the soul. Albeit though the symptoms of the diseases are visible, it is often hard to detect whether their source is of a biological or psychological nature. Human existence is uniformly corporeal, and any stimulus affects both the soul and the bodyregardless of which part of it is affected first. So to treat any disease we need to examine for both physical and emotional causes.</p><h2>Therapeutic Nations: Healing in an Age of Indigenous Human Rights (Critical Issues in Indigenous Studies)</h2><p>Self-determination is on the agenda of Indigenous peoples all over the world. This analysis by an Indigenous feminist scholar challenges the United Nations&#x2013;based human rights agendas and colonial theory that until now have shaped Indigenous models of self-determination. Gender inequality and gender violence, Dian Million argues, are critically important elements in the process of self-determination.<br><br> Million contends that nation-state relations are influenced by a theory of trauma ascendant with the rise of neoliberalism. Such use of trauma theory regarding human rights corresponds to a therapeutic narrative by Western governments negotiating with Indigenous nations as they seek self-determination.<br><br> Focusing on Canada and drawing comparisons with the United States and Australia, Million brings a genealogical understanding of trauma against a historical filter. Illustrating how Indigenous people are positioned differently in Canada, Australia, and the United States in their articulation of trauma, the author particularly addresses the violence against women as a language within a greater politic. The book introduces an Indigenous feminist critique of this violence against the medicalized framework of addressing trauma and looks to the larger goals of decolonization. Noting the influence of humanitarian psychiatry, Million goes on to confront the implications of simply dismissing Indigenous healing and storytelling traditions.<br><br><i>Therapeutic Nations</i> is the first book to demonstrate affect and trauma&#x2019;s wide-ranging historical origins in an Indigenous setting, offering insights into community healing programs. The author&#x2019;s theoretical sophistication and original research make the book relevant across a range of disciplines as it challenges key concepts of American Indian and Indigenous studies.</p><p>Dian Million (Athabascan) is an associate professor of American Indian studies at the University of Washington. The recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship, Million has conducted research in Canada and the United States.&#x201c;Million effortlessly puts the theories produced by Native healing and organizing projects into conversation with theorists across diverse fields. This book is simply brilliant.&#x201d;&#x2014;Andrea Smith, author of <i>Native Americans and the Christian Right: The Gendered Politics of Unlikely Alliances</i><br><br>&#x201c;Million&#x2019;s determination to address dangers on both sides, to avoid binaristic traps, and her care not to dismiss the routes she critiques, require a sophistication and a nimbleness that she is able to supply.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jennifer Henderson, author of <i>Settler Feminism and Race Making in Canada</i><br><br>&#x201c;Million documents how Indigenous appropriation of the language of trauma shifted public discourse away from blaming the deviance of anomic Indians to recognizing Indigenous children and adults as victims of sexual violence and Canada&#x2019;s neocolonialism more broadly.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>International Journal of Transitional Justice</i></p><h2>The Nameless One: First Book of Cade (Edge Chronicles)</h2><p><p><b>Stewart and Riddell return to the world of the Edge Chronicles with the first in a brand new series of adventures starring Cade Quarter</b></p> <p><i>If he didn't get out of the city now, he was as good as dead.</i></p> <p>Cade has never met his uncle, the infamous "descender" Nate Quarter, who years ago committed heresy by lowering himself over the cliff-face of the Edge.

The protagonist is twelve-year-old Donald Duk, who (understandably) hates his own name and doesn't like being Chinese too much either. "His own name is driving him crazy! Looking Chinese is driving him crazy!" Instead, he's taking tap dancing lessons so that he can be Fred Astaire. It is Chinese New Year in San Francisco's Chinatown, and along with the resistant Donald, the reader is swept up in the colorful swirl of activities in the days of feasting, gift-giving, opera performances, and visiting friends and families. Donald's father, King Duk, is a famous local chef. Energetic and warm-hearted, King Duk cooks up his specialties for 300 special guests for New Year's. Donald's mother is Daisy Duk, who seems to understand what's going on with her son without being too worried about it; and his twin sisters are Venus and Penelope. Also along for the holidays are Uncle Donald Duk, the Chinese opera star for whom little Donald is named, and Arnold Azalea, Donald's schoolmate, who is absorbing Chinese-ness with avid fascination. Meanwhile, Donald's nights are being enlivened by dreams of the building of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, a heroic feat that hundreds of nameless Chinese workers undertook. He is startled to realize he is dreaming history, but as his father tells him, "So, don't expect -me to get mad or be surprised the bokgwai never told our history in any of their books you happen to read in the library, looking for yourself. You gotta keep the history yourself or lose it forever, boy." Though Frank Chin's writing is somewhat choppy, the book reads breezily and is a welcome addition to the onrush of Asian American literature this year. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>The eponymous narrator of this first novel, which bulldozes stereotypes about supposed Chinese timidity and passivity, isn't a cartoon character but a smart 12-year-old Chinese-American boy who, with all the vehemence and certainty of youth, spits on everyone and everything Chinese. Although his female characters are underdeveloped and often the humor is broad and seems to exclude its audience, Chin's descriptions are acute and gifted, vivifying the virtuoso technique of Donald's father, who fashions 108 model airplanes--named for Chinese outlaw heroes--that he plans to launch and set afire during the Chinese New Year celebration, and Donald's nighttime dreams, which cast him as an underaged railroad builder in 1869 California, one of 1200 unheralded Chinese workers. The New Year festival in San Francisco's Chinatown becomes Donald's rite of passage and doorway to self-acceptance and -respect; Donald and the reader find themselves on an odyssey that is at once stinging and seductive, reclaiming the exquisite myths of a beautiful and proud ancient civilization.

The four angles - Ascendant, Descendant, MC and IC - reflect the horizon and meridian at the moment of birth, and symbolise the &#39;cross of matter&#39; into which we are born. They describe our participation in external reality, and also clarify how the subtle patterns of belief, attitude and circumstance affect our inner sense of orientation. Each angle is described separately, in terms of the element and mode, and the meaning of the houses which flank it. Transits are also considered, and there is a guided imagery process where the individual horoscope placements are explored. The axis of the Moon&#39;s Nodes represents an arc of meaning along which the activities of &#39;being&#39; and &#39;doing&#39; are balanced, over and over again. Our ability to let go of the past is tested, and we embrace the future from the vantage point of the eternal &#39;now&#39;. This section reviews familiar material, and also offers a number of approaches to the Nodes which the reader will not find elsewhere. There is a review of the Nodes as placed in the six pairs of opposite signs, plus a questionnaire for readers to consider their own Nodes. This book includes astronomical and psychological material, presented in a lively seminar format which will expand the understanding of beginners and experienced astrologers alike.</p><p></p><h2>Love Rules: A Study of the Ten Commandments</h2><p>What do the Ten Commandments do for you?

His task: to destroy the cocaine industry. His name: Cobra. It is the ultimate secret war. But only one side can win...</p><p><strong>Frederick Forsyth on <i>The Cobra</i></strong> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> &#x201c;There are two ways of doing this job,&#x201d; a news agency bureau chief told me once. &#x201c;You can not bother and get it wrong, or take the trouble and get it right. In my office, we get it right.&#x201d; </p> <p> He was a good journalist and taught me a lot. Even when I switched from foreign correspondent to novelist, the training stuck. Even though it is fiction, I try to get it right. </p> <p> Anyway, readers nowadays have been around, seen a lot, traveled a lot. And there is the Internet. If they want to check you out, they can. So if it is uncheckable, you can make it up, but if it can be checked, it had better be right. That is why I go all over, looking, probing, inquiring, conversing in low places, until I am damn certain that even the smallest detail really is the way it is. </p> <p> That includes the weird places to be visited. For <i>The Cobra</i>, a deep delve into the murky world of cocaine, smugglers, Coast Guards, cops, and gangsters, there were certain &#x201c;must-go&#x201d; targets. The HQ of the DEA in Washington, the backstreets of Bogot�, the dockside dives of Cartagena. But the more I researched, the more I came across a recurring name: Guinea-Bissau. </p> <p> Once a Portuguese West African colony, G-B went through eighteen years of independence war and about the same of civil war. The two left it a shattered, burned-out hellhole. The ultimate failed state. It still is. And the cocaine cartels spotted a perfect shipment point for coke going from South America to Europe. They moved in, put almost every major official and politico on the payroll, and began to shift scores of tons of puro through from Colombia to Europe. This I had to see, so I went, posing as a bird-watcher (the swamps and marshes are a wintering ground for European wading birds). </p> <p> It was not my fault I landed in the middle of yet another coup d&#x2019;�tat. It started while I was airborne from Lisbon to Bissau city. When I arrived, my contact was in a hell of a state. Flashing his diplomatic pass, he whisked us both through the formalities. It was two a.m.: sweaty hot. </p> <p> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the hurry?&#x201d; I asked, as he raced his SUV down the pitted track to the city. &#x201c;Look behind you,&#x201d; he said. </p> <p> The horizon in the rearview mirror was aglow with headlights. A vengeful Army was also heading for the city. At eight-thirty the previous evening, someone had put a bucket of Semtex under the Army chief of staff. He was all over the ceiling. The Army reckoned it was the President&#x2014;different tribes and eternal enemies. They were coming to settle accounts. </p> <p> I was in my hotel by three a.m. but unable to sleep, so I put on the light. It was the only modern hotel and had a generator. There is no public lighting in Bissau. At four-thirty, trying to read, I heard the boom, about five hundred yards down the street. Not thunder, not a head-on crash. Ammo, big ammo. One remembers the sound. Actually, it was the Army putting an RPG through the President&#x2019;s bedroom window. </p> <p> It seems the explosion did not kill the old boy, even at seventy-one. He crawled out of bed. Then the building collapsed on him. Still alive, he crawled from the rubble to the lawn, where the soldiers were waiting. They shot him three times in the chest. When he still wouldn&#x2019;t die, they realized he had a juju that made him immune to bullets. </p> <p> But that juju cannot prevail against machetes. Everyone knows that. So they chopped him up. He died. </p> <p> The next day was kind of quiet, apart from the patrolling Army jeeps bristling with the usual Kalashnikovs, looking for the murderers of their boss. My contact waved his diplomatic pass; I beamed and distributed signed photos of a smiling Queen Elizabeth, with assurances that she wished them well (the Third World reveres the queen, even with a facsimile signature). We were waved through. </p> <p> The airport was closed; ditto the borders. I was trapped inside, but no one could get in either. In the trade, it&#x2019;s called an exclusive. So I borrowed my host&#x2019;s mobile and filed a thousand-word summing-up to London&#x2019;s Daily Express, for whom I do a weekly column. I had the Express call me back and dictated the story to a lady with earphones in London. No one has filed news like that since Dan Rather was in college. Old-fashioned, but secure from intercept, I thought. </p> <p> But of course the NSA at Fort Meade, Maryland, heard it all and told the CIA. In the matter of coups in West Africa, I have what London&#x2019;s Cockneys call &#x201c;a bit of previous.&#x201d; I wrote The Dogs of War long ago about that very subject. </p> <p> After the story, half the West&#x2019;s media was trying to get me, but I was out in the creeks checking out the sumptuous mansion of the Colombians, notable for their ponytails, chains of gold bling, and black-windowed SUVs. When I got back to Bissau, a very voluble wife, Sandy, was on the phone. </p> <p> It seems she was fixing a lunch date with a girlfriend and explained in her e-mail: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m free for lunch &#x2019;cos Freddie is away in Guinea-Bissau.&#x201d; Mistake. The e-mail vanished off the screen unfinished. Her mailbox vaporized. Database wiped. Instructions appeared on her screen: &#x201c;Do not open this file. Cease all sending or we will respond.&#x201d; </p> <p> I had a zany mental image of the morning conference at Langley. Corner suite, seventh floor, Old Building. </p> <p> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this going on in Africa, Chuck?&#x201d; </p> <p> &#x201c;A coup in Guinea-Bissau, Director. Several assassinations. It could be that damn limey again.&#x201d; </p> <p> &#x201c;Can we take him out of there?&#x201d; </p> <p> &#x201c;It seems not. He is somewhere in the jungle.&#x201d; </p> <p> &#x201c;Well, zap his wife&#x2019;s lunch dates. That&#x2019;ll teach him.&#x201d; </p> <p> The same night, I dined with new friends, and my neighbor at the table was an elderly Dutchman. &#x201c;You work here?&#x201d; I asked. </p> <p> &#x201c;Ja. Three-year secondment. I am a forensic pathologist. I run the mortuary.&#x201d; </p> <p> The only things that work in Bissau are the gift-aid projects donated by the developed world. The Dutch built the modern mortuary. Shrewdly, they put it next to the locally run general hospital. Smart, because no one leaves the hospital save feetfirst on a gurney heading for the morgue. </p> <p> &#x201c;Been busy?&#x201d; I asked. He nodded solemnly. </p> <p> &#x201c;Ja, very busy all day. Stitching the President back together.&#x201d; </p> <p> It seemed the government wanted the old boy in his coffin more or less in the right order. I tucked into my stewed goat. </p> <p> It took three days for things to calm down and the airport to reopen. I was on the next flight to Lisbon and London. At Heathrow, a passport officer checked the stamps, raised an eyebrow, and passed the document to a colleague. He contemplated both the passport and its owner for a while, then gave it back. </p> <p> &#x201c;How was Guinea-Bissau, Mr. Forsyth?&#x201d; he asked mildly. </p> <p> &#x201c;Cancel the vacation,&#x201d; I advised. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t like it.&#x201d; Both smiled thinly. Officials don&#x2019;t do that. Never jest with officialdom. I stepped out into the crisp morning air of March 1, 2009. Beautifully cool. Good to be home. </p> <p> Of course, West Africa got its own back. It always does. Twenty days later, my left leg blew up like a vegetable marrow, a real prizewinner. Dark red and hurting like hell. The first medic thought deep vein thrombosis. Bull feathers. Even I know DVT cuts in much sooner after the jet flight and there is no swelling. </p> <p> The second surgeon did an ultrasound scan and got it in one. A sting, a bite, a scratch, who knows? But leading to a pretty vicious staphylococcal infection, aka septicemia or blood poisoning. </p> <p> So into ER went the old scribe, and then to ICU. They pumped enough amoxicillin into a catheter to sink the USS Saratoga and saved the leg, though they were close to scrubbing up to take it off. </p> <p> I came out after three weeks and spent the rest of the summer finishing the research among our Special Forces. Then wrote the novel October through December. Now it is with the publisher, due out mid-August. </p> <p> So if you are interested, dear reader, it&#x2019;s all in <i>The Cobra</i>. The dives of Cartagena, the U.S. Navy SEALs, their British equivalents the SBS, the Global Predator UAVs, oh, and dear old Guinea-Bissau. And it&#x2019;s all true. Well, okay, it&#x2019;s not all true, it&#x2019;s a novel. But it&#x2019;s accurate. </p> <p> <i>--Frederick Forsyth</i> </p>Frederick Forsyth is the author of fourteen novels and short story collections, from 1971's <i>The Day of the Jackal</i> to 2003's <i>Avenger</i>.

This compelling history, culminating in the execution of Charles I, brings to life the people who fought in it, died in it, and in doing so changed the history of the world forever. In an excitingly fresh approach to the period, Diane Purkiss tells the story of this critical era not just in terms of the battle of ideas, but as the histories of the people who conceived them. The English Civil War builds a gripping narrative of the individuals involved and their motives, from those whose reputations were made on the back of this violent and brutal war, such as Oliver Cromwell and Lady Eleanor Davies, to witchfinders and revolutionaries; and ultimately, the ordinary men who fought and the women who lived with tragedy, finding their political voice for the first time. The consequences of ten years of bloody revolution were to stretch from the cities to the villages to the grand houses, form Ulster to East Anglia to the outer reaches of Cornwall.The tales uncovered by Diane Purkiss paint a picture of a world turned upside down, where madness and prophesy play their part, and where normal life and times are suspended. This important book uncovers forgotten lives and illustrates incisively the critical contribution of this extraordinary period in English history to contemporary politics and society.</p><p>Diane Purkiss is Fellow and Tutor at Keble College, Oxford. She was formerly Professor of English at Exeter University. She is the author of the highly acclaimed `The Witch in History&#39;, and `Troublesome Things: A History of Fairies and Fairy Stories&#39;.There are many ways to approach the history of the 17th-century upheaval that beheaded a king and laid the foundations for democratic revolutions to come, and this absorbing, ungainly study tries them all. Oxford historian Purkiss (<i>The Witch in History</i>) draws a gallery of sharp biographical sketches of participants from Cromwell to ordinary soldiers, paying special attention to the oft-neglected doings of women, like aristocratic intriguer Lucy Hay and radical dissenter Anna Trapnel. She also slathers on plenty of social history, digressing on everything from contemporary housing to cookbooks. And she interweaves an avowedly disjointed, episodic kings-and-battles narrative of military campaigns and political maneuverings, replete with dramatic eyewitness accounts. Fixated on trees rather than the forest, Purkiss offers no clear overview of events or much coherent interpretation of the conflict, aside from some facile psychoanalysis ("Charles I's longing to make the monarchy independent of any hurtful criticism proceeded from the bullied child he was"). The book doesn't work as a general introduction, but readers who already know some of the history will find it full of colorful personalities and scenes and evocative period writings that bring to life the people, culture and violent turmoil of the age.

Boyne</b> is the former director of the National Air &amp; Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution. Boyne's books have made both the fiction and the nonfiction bestseller lists of <i>The New York Times</i>. His novels <i>Roaring Thunder</i> and <i>Supersonic Thunder</i> cover the first forty-four years of jet aviation. His critically acclaimed nonfiction book, <i>Dawn Over Kitty Hawk</i>, recounts the story of the Wright Brothers. A retired Air Force Colonel, Boyne was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame class of 2007.1&nbsp;The Man of Influence&nbsp;In just sixty years the United States Air Force has grown from a disorganized giant, mired in the jumble of too rapid demobilization after World War II, to the most influential military service in the world today. In the process it has achieved triumphant successes that exceeded even the promise of its evocative song "The Wild Blue Yonder" while overcoming haunting failures of concept, equipment, and personnel.&nbsp;Fortunately for the United States and the world, the successes have vastly outnumbered the failures in both number and degree. Until September 11, 2001, the Air Force has been a significant, if not the principal, factor in the remarkable victories of both the Gulf War and the Cold War. Every leader of the United States Air Force, from Secretary to Chief of Staff to squadron commander, would be quick to note that these triumphs were won in concert with the Army and the Navy. No matter how hotly the three services contend for roles and missions, appropriations, media attention, and public support, the serious bickering stops when it comes to battle. The concept of joint operations, so successful in World War II, was not always observed in the intervening years, but was demonstrated admirably in the Gulf War, operations in the Balkins, in Afghanistan, and in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Nonetheless, while much of what will be said applies equally to its sister services, this book will focus on the United States Air Force.&nbsp;The Air Force achieved its great successes despite a number of formidable obstacles, foreign and domestic. The first and most immediate of these was the talented, focused, and effective air forces of the Soviet Union, which developed excellent equipment in massive numbers along with the strategy and tactics to use it. The USSR shared its capabilities bountifully with its satellite states, some of which were destined to become fierce opponents of the United States. The threat of the Soviet Union was real, massive, and seemingly never-ending. Soviet nuclear missile capability, exaggerated at first, soon grew to immense proportions. And while the Soviet Union is no more, its missile force, now divided among three of the survivor states, Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, not only remains but is perhaps more threatening because its control is far less certain.&nbsp;There were less obvious but equally important hazards at home. The first of these was the continual requirement to cope not only with the vagaries of the Congressional budgeting process but also with the growing restrictions inherent in oversight--a kindly term for micromanagement by both Congress and the Executive Branch. The second was the telling loss of public support, almost two decades in duration, resulting from distaste for the war in Vietnam. For the first time in its history, members of the United States Air Force found themselves publicly vilified for doing what they had been ordered to do. And while the prestige of the USAF has been largely restored today, there lurks a reservoir of antimilitary sentiment still to be found in the media, in academia, and, surprisingly, in the government.&nbsp;Most remarkably, even while the Air Force struggled to overcome these varied challenges, it created and maintained a unique ability to plan far into the future. The Air Force's reliance on technology was perhaps inherent in the very science of flight itself. More than the Army or the Navy, and more than the services of other nations, including the Soviet Union, the Air Force put its faith in advanced technologies. Fostered from the very start by General of the Air Force Henry H. "Hap" Arnold, and encouraged by succeeding Chiefs of Staff, the Air Force not only made the funds available for research, it granted credibility and opportunity to the military and civilian personnel who pursued technology as a career. The funding was not always constant, for wartime operational considerations invariably drained funds away from research, but the basic idea that research and development was the essential element for the continued success of the Air Force always remained.&nbsp;Despite every effort to avoid the characteristics and the operating methods of a giant bureaucracy, the very size and age of the Air Force has made it one. Prescience is not normally associated with a huge organization, yet the Air Force has over the years managed to endow its leadership and its operating forces with the ability to anticipate future requirements for equipment and training. The phenomenal result has been that the Air Force, operating under the budget constraints imposed upon all the services, has managed all current crises while doing the necessary research and development to accelerate the technologies necessary for future conflicts.&nbsp;For forty years the principal task of the United States Air Force was to deter offensive action by the Soviet Union. The USAF accomplished this in part by combining the experience and techniques gained in the employment of air power in World War II with an ever increasing arsenal of atomic weapons, including the intercontinental ballistic missile. The rest of the task was achieved when the Air Force, drawn reluctantly and against its instincts into the space age, responded by capitalizing on the opportunity to create an amazing array of new technologies.&nbsp;At the same time, the USAF had to respond to other challenges. Some of these were of the monumental size and scope of the Korean and Vietnamese wars, while some were less threatening, like the invasions of Grenada and Panama. In addition, the USAF had to undertake disaster relief at home and abroad, as well as show the flag and project power. And all the while, it had to deal with major social issues ranging from the integration of black personnel into the service, to overcoming civilian distaste for the military during and after the Vietnam War period, to providing equal opportunity for women and minorities.&nbsp;Despite the multifaceted nature of the Air Force's tasks, it was successful in almost all of them, all the while containing the Soviet Union and making the most vital contributions to winning the Cold War. It was next thrust into a peacekeeping role in the Balkans. Then, as the global war on terror became manifest, it became actively engaged in new operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.&nbsp;In retrospect, the years of the Cold War have a monolithic quality, as if there had been an unchanging confrontation with the Soviet Union which the Air Force steadfastly met with unchanging means. Yet it was not so, for the nature of the threat changed almost annually, forcing a corresponding change in the Air Force's response. In the very early years, at the time of the Berlin Blockade, the Air Force's response was a hollow one, brandishing a nearly empty nuclear arsenal at a gigantic array of Soviet forces. As the years passed, the Soviet Union, through its surrogates, challenged the United States all around the world, in each instance with a minimal involvement of its own troops. Thus it fought the Korean War with North Korean and Chinese forces, supplemented by Soviet equipment, training, and limited personnel. It supported the North Vietnamese in a similar economic manner, letting another country bleed for its own purposes. The same pattern prevailed in the Middle East, in Africa, and ultimately as close as Cuba. With the Soviet Union tugging at the seams of countries all around the world, the U.S. policy of containment, begun by President Truman, was an expensive one.&nbsp;Yet it was ultimately successful, despite the lack of a decision in Korea and the loss of the war in Vietnam. Over the years, the United States Air Force, both the benefactor and the beneficiary of the American system of free enterprise, was able to build air and missile forces that kept the Soviet Union within the general sphere of influence allotted to it at Yalta.&nbsp;The Soviet Union was not only contained, it was strained, its military budget consuming it economically and technically. The Soviet advances in military equipment and in space exploration were obtained by investments that matched and often exceeded those of the United States, particularly as a percentage of gross national product. The tremendous expenditures were at the expense of a rational expansion of the USSR's civilian economy. The productive capacity of the Soviet Union, channeled so single-mindedly into its military efforts (for its space program was primarily for military purposes), was unable to develop an industrial base with a technology and a market structure comparable to those of its old Western enemies or of the emerging nations of Asia. The USSR's atrophied civilian industrial base made its military burden increasingly difficult to bear by 1980, and impossible to bear a decade later.&nbsp;In that critical ten-year period, three separate undertakings by the United States spelled the downfall of the Soviet Union. The first was the buildup of American arms that began in 1980 and reversed the decline in strength that had occurred under the Carter administration. The Soviet economy, already almost exhausted, was strained beyond endurance by the requirement to match the American buildup.&nbsp;The second undertaking was the dazzling if ultimately unfulfilled prospects of President Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" program. The grandiose project was obviously beyond the capacity of the Soviet Union to match; the risk that the United States might succeed was too much for Soviet leaders to contemplate.&nbsp;The third, and conclusive, element was the overwhelming success of our weapons in the Persian Gulf War. The invulnerability of the stealth fighter and the incredible military--and public relations--effect of precision-guided munitions completely disheartened the political and military leaders of the Soviet Union. With their economy imploding under the strain of seventy-four years of corruption and inefficiency, the Soviet leaders were finally compelled to admit that their system had failed, and to abandon--at least temporarily--their historic quest for world domination. Just as Mussolini's corrupt Fascism withered and died almost overnight, so did the Soviet Union and its single political component, the Communist Party, swiftly dissolve into a nightmare of confusion and recrimination.&nbsp;The Soviet Union, suddenly exposed as a gigantic empty rust belt of industrial and political folly, simply shut down, leaving its people to its own devices, for better or for worse. Its huge military forces, overwhelming in both their conventional and nuclear might, almost instantaneously went from being a threat to the very existence of the world to embarrassing centers of poverty, unable to feed, equip, or clothe their recruits, sometimes unable even to pay their electric bills.&nbsp;Yet winning the Cold War was only part of the United States Air Force's task during the first fifty years of its existence. Each decade presented a new challenge that it had to handle as a "part-time" job, subsidiary to the principal task of nuclear deterrence. Some of the challenges were internal: adapting to social change, meeting equipment deficiencies, trying each year to do more with less. Other challenges were external, from the sobering experience in Korea through the demoralizing agony of Vietnam to the exhilaration of winning the Persian Gulf War. The exertions of the global war on terror after 9/11 were compounded by additional requirements for compassionate relief efforts and the increasing interest in securing our borders from illegal immigration.&nbsp;Each challenge was overcome by the men and women of the Air Force, who were simultaneously accomplishing another remarkable feat. Even as they endured the rigors and uncertainties of service life, with its frequent moves, relatively low pay, and often disagreeable jobs, the men and women of the Air Force moved into the mainstream of the American community, and indeed became the United States in microcosm. The old concept of a military base being apart from the community, a self-sufficient entity with its own standards and mores, faded away. USAF personnel increasingly broke away from the frontier outpost outlook that had characterized the military for so many years and instead became active members of their communities, owning homes, working second jobs, sending their children to school, paying taxes, and generally becoming indistinguishable from their civilian neighbors.&nbsp;One of the most remarkable aspects of this transformation from a parochial group with an essentially garrison mentality into a fundamental part of American society is that it has been rarely perceived and little remarked upon, even by members of the Air Force. People both within and without the Air Force still tend to think of it as a separate social entity, as distinct from being a separate business entity. The fact is that the composition of the Air Force population is essentially identical to the composition of the American populace as a whole, and as such reflects the trends, the biases, the problems, and the potential of that populace.&nbsp;One of the most interesting questions about the Air Force is how it managed to foresee its equipment and weapons needs as much one or two decades in advance. The successes obtained in World War II might be attributed to a specialized leadership, trained for twenty years with but a single goal, that of establishing air superiority with conventional weapons of the times. The postwar successes, each one perhaps as important as success in battle had been in World War II, resulted from the quick and precise execution of plans that would have been deemed grandiose if they had not succeeded. Among the most remarkable of these for the grandeur of their conception, planning, and execution are the deployment of not one but four intercontinental ballistic missile systems, the establishment of a comprehensive continental radar defense, and the systematic exploitation of the possibilities of space for war and other military purposes.&nbsp;In the meantime, besides leading the way to victory in the Cold War, the Air Force has, almost off the back of its hand, fought four major and three minor wars, while leading the nation in the process of integrating minorities and women into the service. During the same interval, it has transitioned from a primarily nuclear strike force pitted against a superpower into one capable of responding to regional conflicts with conventional arms, while still maintaining a decisive nuclear capacity.&nbsp;The answers to the question of the source of the Air Force's general success in operation and in anticipation will be revealed in the following chapters. In essence, the Air Force's success derived from having the right leaders at the right time at the officer level and, perhaps surprisingly but even more importantly, at the noncommissioned officer level. Obtaining those leaders derived from the Air Force's intrinsic ability to attract high-caliber personalities to serve, and from a carefully cultivated culture that allows persons of talent to reach the top. The relationship between officers, noncommissioned officers, and enlisted personnel in the USAF is unique, and stems from a tradition created in the old days when commissioned pilots realized that their lives depended upon noncommissioned crew chiefs--and treated them accordingly. The sense of mutual respect and mutual importance is pervasive in the Air Force today,...</p><h2>The Easter Story (Brick Bible for Kids)</h2><p>As in all the Brick Bible books, Brendan Powell Smith creates a magical &#x201c;brick&#x201d; world&#x2014;all in LEGOs&#x2014;to illustrate a story from the Bible that is then photographed and accompanied by a simple text. <i>The Easter Story</i>, the heart of Christianity, illustrated in LEGOs, tells of Jesus&#x2019; arrival in Jerusalem on a donkey, greeted by crowds with palm branches; followed by the Last Supper, with Jesus and his disciples sharing bread and wine; then Good Friday, when Jesus was crucified on the cross and then his body buried in a cave tomb and covered with a rock; and concluding with Easter Sunday, when Jesus&#x2019; disciples visited the tomb to discover Jesus had been risen from the dead and resurrected.

He is the unwitting star of a nonstop, 24-hour-a-day documentary soap opera called <em>The Truman Show</em>, with every moment of his life broadcast to a worldwide audience. Everyone around him is an actor. He is a prisoner in a made-for-TV paradise. This is the story of his escape.</p><p>Rarely has a first-time collaboration between a writer and director produced such a stunning result. In this book, both Niccol and Weir's lively talents and creative force come to light, as each contributes some highly original material to amplify the brilliant107-page shooting script, reproduced here in facsimile. Niccol has given us another version of <em>The Truman Show</em>, in photos and captions&#x2014;in effect, our very own photo album. For his contribution, Peter Weir chose to let us in on the intricately detailed, often hilarious "backstory," which he wrote as part of his preparation, and eventually shared with the cast and crew during production. Also included are complete cast and crew credits.</p></p><p>Jim Carrey is getting smarter and smarter. The crude, rich clown took far less than the $20 million he could have gotten in order to star in Peter Weir's film <i>The Truman Show</i>, which made the covers of <i>Time</i> and <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> as "The Year's Best Movie." Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man whose entire life has been a hit TV docudrama without his knowledge. This screenplay (by <i>Gattaca</i> author Andrew Niccol) is required reading, and the 35 good-quality color stills from the film in the photo album at the center of the book are nicely laid out with helpful, intelligent captions.<p> But <i>The Truman Show: The Shooting Script</i> also offers something not found in theaters: the back-story to the script, written by director Weir, who has never been weirder. It was so important to the creation of the movie that Weir actually hired Harry Shearer to help create a "mockumentary"--a documentary on the making of the movie. The mockumentary was scrapped, though a few scenes wound up in the finished film; what Weir gives you here is the whole prequel, "A Short History of <i>The Truman Show</i>." It tells how Christof (played by Ed Harris in the film), a promising, idealistic, Oscar-winning documentarian concerned with homeless people, conspired with shady ex-NASA operatives and the terrifying Omnicam Corp. to create a fake town full of actors and imprison the unsuspecting child Truman Burbank in it by messing with his head. For instance, they made Truman afraid of water so that he wouldn't swim away from his "home." It's a trip--and it just might provide a peek into certain dark crannies of the mind of Oscar-winning director Peter Weir.

Should the gospel be proclaimed in words only? Or should we preach the gospel in deeds&#x2015;and when necessary use words? Or are we missing something in playing the witness of words against deeds? If you are concerned about evangelizing the post-Christian West or the world beyond, you have probably debated this issue. And evangelical instincts drive us to Scripture. In <em>Recovering the Full Mission of God</em>, Dean Flemming joins biblical scholarship with missionary experience as he surveys the Old Testament and then looks closely at the New Testament and the early church. Flemming shows how the three strands of telling, doing and being relate in the mission of God and his people. Here is a book in touch with the missional realities of our time and grounded in the missional vision of biblical revelation. It gives us a clear vision of the rich and multifaceted nature of "gospeling" the kingdom of God.</p><p>Dean Flemming (PhD, Aberdeen) is professor of New Testament and missions at MidAmerica Nazarene University in Olathe, Kansas. He has spent more than twenty years as a missionary educator in Asia and Europe and is the author of a commentary on Philippians and <em>Contextualization in the New Testament</em>, which won a 2006 <em>Christianity Today</em> book award."Flemming's exposition of the biblical texts and their theology of mission is sound and presented in a clear and compelling way." (The Bible Today, May 14, 2014)<br><br>"'What God has joined together, let not man put asunder.' How frustrating it is that so much evangelical thinking about mission continues to do exactly that, splitting up word and deed, evangelism and social engagement, and then struggling to reconcile them when we should never have divorced them in the first place. This superb book by Dean Flemming leads us on a richly biblical journey that takes us back to the 'one flesh' that God intended--the integration of being, doing and speaking in the mission of God's people. It is deeply nourishing and satisfying, ranging through biblical texts from Genesis to Revelation, yet never losing the reader in technicalities or detail and consistently easy to read and practical in application. The portraits of Jesus and Paul are particularly balanced and convincing, while the lessons we learn from the early church and the book of Revelation are truly eye-opening. Pastors, missions pastors and committees, mission boards and executives--please read this book! Preach through it. Work through it with your people. It will revitalize and rebalance your understanding and practice of mission." (Christopher J. H. Wright, International Ministries Director, Langham Partnership)<br><br>"Dean Flemming is not satisfied with the hardened divisions we so often encounter in talk about the church's job description--divisions like evangelism or social witness, proclaiming the message or living it. Reading the two disciplines together, biblical studies and missiology, he insists that the discussion must start in the basic recognition of the church's missional identity. The result is a missional reading of the Bible, especially the New Testament, that provides the coordinates for hearing Scripture anew as witness to God's call to his people to participate in God's mission." (Joel B. Green, professor of New Testament interpretation, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"In this balanced and insightful book, Dean Flemming argues persuasively that Christian mission, as participation in God's mission and rooted in the entire scriptural narrative, is always multifaceted and holistic. It involves being, doing and telling--each aspect enhancing the others. Grounded in the author's rich experience and fine scholarship, this book has the potential to reshape and reinvigorate the church's missional identity, deeds and words." (Michael J. Gorman, Raymond E. Brown Professor of Biblical Studies and Theology, St. Mary's Seminary University, Baltimore)<br><br>"This is an excellent book--a marvelous contribution to the ongoing discussion of the nature of mission. With sterling biblical scholarship Dean Flemming demonstrates clearly from the biblical story, and especially the New Testament, that the church's mission is full-orbed, encompassing life, word and deed. The careful treatment of the Old Testament story and a wide range of the New Testament canon should go a long way to fill out more reductionist understandings of mission. I hope this book gets a wide reading." (Michael Goheen, professor of missional theology, Newbigin House of Studies, San Francisco, and author of A Light to the Nations)<br><br>"Dean Fleming is well qualified to take on this project, a project which is both important and provocative. His background (PhD, Aberdeen) and experience on the field and in the classroom give him a unique perspective. His experiences in Europe and Asia allow him to write with authority in the fields of missiology and biblical theology. . . . I have no hesitation in recommending this text for classroom use, and as a useful contribution to the ongoing conversation on 'being, doing and telling.'" (John W. Nyquist, Missiology, July 2015)<br><br>"This is a thoughtful practical book . . . Flemming's analysis and resulting synthesis are consistently straightforward and accessible, and non-specialists will appreciate how this close reading of the biblical text is presented without overly sophisticated jargon or forbidding theoretical framing."

But everything changes when she turns eighteen and finds that her loving father has made a secret vow which will shatter her life, forcing her to marry a man she hardly knows and sending her to the exotic, golden city of Jerusalem. On her wedding day, she enters a strange and foreign world steeped in tradition and surrounded by myth.

Ragen attended Brooklyn College and earned her master's in English from Hebrew University. An American, she has lived in Jerusalem since 1971. She was recently voted one of the three most popular authors in Israel.</p>Abraham Ha-Levi, a wealthy Los Angeles businessman, is the sole heir to a 300-year-old Hasidic dynasty. Believing himself unworthy to take on the mantle of leadership, he makes a solemn vow to God to continue the distinguished lineage through his only child, Batsheva. When he marries her off at 18 to a young Talmudic scholar, Isaac Harshen, they live in the ultra-fanatic religious quarters of Meah Shearim in Jerusalem. Beautiful and intelligent, Batsheva struggles valiantly to be a true daughter of Israel, obedient to her husband and the laws of Hasidic life. But her inquisitive nature and desire for secular knowledge (her favorite books are Anna Karenina and Women in Love ) challenge Isaac's narrow view of her role as wife and mother. When his abusiveness threatens their young son's well-being, she makes a dramatic escape, winding up in London, where she falls in love with a man studying for the priesthood. Batsheva's Jewish faith survives her spiritual and intellectual quests, and she returns to Jerusalem to confront Isaac, demanding freedom for herself and her child. Ragen's impeccable knowledge of Jewish law and lore allows us a deep understanding of orthodox Jewish life from a woman's point of view. Despite eloquent writing and vivid characters, however, her first novel falters under convenient plot machinations that compromise the full development of its religious and emotional themes. 100,000 first printing. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Complete Works of E.

Inventive, amusing, magnetic, sad, and alive with unforgettable men and women -- brimming with truth, compassion, and a lyrical magic that strikes the soul -- this novel is a masterpiece in the art of fiction.</p><p><i>"Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buend�a was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice."</i><p> It is typical of Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez that it will be many pages before his narrative circles back to the ice, and many chapters before the hero of <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>, Buend�a, stands before the firing squad. In between, he recounts such wonders as an entire town struck with insomnia, a woman who ascends to heaven while hanging laundry, and a suicide that defies the laws of physics: </p><blockquote> A trickle of blood came out under the door, crossed the living room, went out into the street, continued on in a straight line across the uneven terraces, went down steps and climbed over curbs, passed along the Street of the Turks, turned a corner to the right and another to the left, made a right angle at the Buend�a house, went in under the closed door, crossed through the parlor, hugging the walls so as not to stain the rugs, went on to the other living room, made a wide curve to avoid the dining-room table, went along the porch with the begonias, and passed without being seen under Amaranta's chair as she gave an arithmetic lesson to Aureliano Jos�, and went through the pantry and came out in the kitchen, where �rsula was getting ready to crack thirty-six eggs to make bread.<br> "Holy Mother of God!" �rsula shouted. </blockquote><p> The story follows 100 years in the life of Macondo, a village founded by Jos� Arcadio Buend�a and occupied by descendants all sporting variations on their progenitor's name: his sons, Jos� Arcadio and Aureliano, and grandsons, Aureliano Jos�, Aureliano Segundo, and Jos� Arcadio Segundo. Then there are the women--the two �rsulas, a handful of Remedios, Fernanda, and Pilar--who struggle to remain grounded even as their menfolk build castles in the air. If it is possible for a novel to be highly comic and deeply tragic at the same time, then <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> does the trick. Civil war rages throughout, hearts break, dreams shatter, and lives are lost, yet the effect is literary pentimento, with sorrow's outlines bleeding through the vibrant colors of Garc�a M�rquez's magical realism. Consider, for example, the ghost of Prudencio Aguilar, whom Jos� Arcadio Buend�a has killed in a fight. So lonely is the man's shade that it haunts Buend�a's house, searching anxiously for water with which to clean its wound.

They drew the three continents in countless shapes and sizes on their maps, but occasionally they hinted at the existence of a "fourth part of the world," a mysterious, inaccessible place, separated from the rest by a vast expanse of ocean. It was a land of myth&#x2014;until 1507, that is, when Martin Waldseem�ller and Matthias Ringmann, two obscure scholars working in the mountains of eastern France, made it real. Columbus had died the year before convinced that he had sailed to Asia, but Waldseem�ller and Ringmann, after reading about the Atlantic discoveries of Columbus&#x2019;s contemporary Amerigo Vespucci, came to a startling conclusion: Vespucci had reached the fourth part of the world. To celebrate his achievement, Waldseem�ller and Ringmann printed a huge map, for the first time showing the New World surrounded by water and distinct from Asia, and in Vespucci&#x2019;s honor they gave this New World a name: America.<br> <br><i>The Fourth Part of the World </i>is the story behind that map, a thrilling saga of geographical and intellectual exploration, full of outsize thinkers and voyages. Taking a kaleidoscopic approach, Toby Lester traces the origins of our modern worldview. His narrative sweeps across continents and centuries, zeroing in on different portions of the map to reveal strands of ancient legend, Biblical prophecy, classical learning, medieval exploration, imperial ambitions, and more. In Lester&#x2019;s telling the map comes alive: Marco Polo and the early Christian missionaries trek across Central Asia and China; Europe&#x2019;s early humanists travel to monastic libraries to recover ancient texts; Portuguese merchants round up the first West African slaves; Christopher Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci make their epic voyages of discovery; and finally, vitally, Nicholas Copernicus makes an appearance, deducing from the new geography shown on the Waldseem�ller map that the earth could not lie at the center of the cosmos. The map literally altered humanity&#x2019;s worldview.<br> <br>One thousand copies of the map were printed, yet only one remains. Discovered accidentally in 1901 in the library of a German castle it was bought in 2003 for the unprecedented sum of $10 million by the Library of Congress, where it is now on permanent public display. Lavishly illustrated with rare maps and diagrams, <i>The Fourth Part of the World </i>is the story of that map: the dazzling story of the geographical and intellectual journeys that have helped us decipher our world.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Simon Winchester Reviews <em>The Fourth Part of the World</em></strong><br><br> <b>Simon Winchester studied geology at Oxford and later became an award-winning journalist, and author of more than a dozen books.

Read Simon Winchester&#x2019;s exclusive Amazon guest review of <i>The Fourth Part of the World</i>:</b><br><br> Books about obscure and unobvious commercial subjects, written with passion by stylish enthusiasts, have come in recent years to provide us a canon of the most valuable and lasting literature. Toby Lester, who appears to be a master of the language and a man evidently as inquisitive as a ferret, has written a quite wonderful book about something that is, yes, obscure and unobvious commercial--but which is a tale quite vital to anyone interested in knowing the story of this country. It is about the naming of America, and the creation of a document that has been lately and justly called <i>this country's birth-certificate.</i> <p></p> <p> The document is a map--and so Mr. Lester's book is in essence about cartography, and sixteenth century cartography at that, a specialist's dream. But the tale of the making and then the hiding and the losing and the finding of this extraordinary and very large document--it called the Waldseem�ller Map, and it now belongs to the Library of Congress--is sufficiently exciting to be almost unbearably thrilling. And anyone who can make cartography thrill deserves a medal, at the very least. </p> <p> The mapmakers in question were German: Martin Waldseem�ller and his poetically-inclined colleague, Mathias Ringmann. Come the beginning of the sixteenth century, and working in southern France these two, like many in the European intellectual world, were beginning to hear rumors that a new continent had lately been found, halfway between Spain and Japan. (This was fifteen years after Columbus, who still had no clue what he had found in 1492--to his dying day he insisted that he had merely found a hitherto unknown piece of Asia.) </p> <p> The rumors swiftly became accepted fact: in the early 1500s the pair came across two printed accounts of the alleged new continent--accounts that were prolix, flamboyant, unreliable and in parts very saucy (there was material relating to the cosmetic self-mutilation, anal cleanliness and sexual practices of the locals) written by a colourful Italian explorer and sorcerer named Amerigo Vespucci. Crucially Vespucci claimed in one of these papers that &#x201c;on this last voyage of mine...I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous peoples than in our Europe, Asia or Africa, and in addition I found a more pleasant and temperate climate than in any other region known to us...&#x201d; </p> <p> As it happened, the mapmakers had already been commissioned to create a new world map--and so on it, they both agreed after reading Vespucci's accounts, they would now draw this new body of land, and they would give it a name. After some head-scratching they agreed the name should be the feminine form of the Latinised version of Amerigo Vespucci's Christian name: the properly feminine place-nouns of Africa, Asia and Europe would now be joined, quite simply, by a brand-new entity that they would name <i>America.</i> </p> <p> And so, in 1507, their map was duly published; and in large letters across the southern half of the southern continental discovery, just where Brazil is situated today, was the single word: <i>America.</i> It was written in majuscule script, was a tiny bit crooked, curiously out of scale and looking a little last-minute and just a little tentative--but nevertheless and incontrovertibly, it was <i>there.</i> </p> <p> It caught on: a globe published in Paris in 1515 placed the word on both segments of the continent, north and south. The word was published in many books in central Europe--Strasbourg in 1509, Poland in 1512, Vienna in 1520; it was found in a Spanish book in 1520. In Strasbourg, five years later, another book lists 'America' as one of the world's regions and finally, in 1538, Mercator, the new arbiter of the planet's geography, placed the names <i>North America</i> and <i>South America</i> squarely on the two halves of the fourth continent. And with that, the name was secure; and it would never be changed again. </p> <p> Toby Lester has done American history the greatest service by writing this elegant and thoughtful account of the one morsel of cartographic history that would shake the world's foundations. We are told that this is his first book: may we hope that he writes many more, for his is a rare and masterly talent. <em>--SW</em></p><p> </p><p> (Photo � Setsuko Winchester) </p> <br><strong>Discover the Waldseem�ller World Map from <i>The Fourth Part of the World</i></strong><br>Click on image to enlarge<br><br> <strong> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br>Click to discover the Waldseem�ller map legend</td></tr> </tbody> </table> <br> <table><tbody><tr> <td> <br>This legend highlights an idea that's almost completely forgotten today: that the New World was remarkable to Europeans in 1507 because it lay not just to the west but also to the south.

Lajos Egri&#39;s classic, The Art of Dramatic Writing, does just that, with instruction that can be applied equally well to a short story, novel, or screenplay. Examining a play from the inside out, Egri starts with the heart of any drama: its characters. All good dramatic writing hinges on people and their relationships, which serve to move the story forward and give it life, as well as an understanding of human motives -- why people act the way that they do. Using examples from everything from William Shakespeare&#39;s Romeo and Juliet to Henrik Ibsen&#39;s A Doll&#39;s House, Egri shows how it is essential for the author to have a basic premise -- a thesis, demonstrated in terms of human behavior -- and to develop the dramatic conflict on the basis of that behavior. Using Egri&#39;s ABCs of premise, character, and conflict, The Art of Dramatic Writing is a direct, jargon-free approach to the problem of achieving truth in writing.</p><p>For many years, Lajos Egri's highly opinionated but very enjoyable <i>The Art of Dramatic Writing</i> has been a well-guarded secret of playwrights, scriptwriters, and writers for television. Unlike many other books on playwrighting (several of which Egri criticizes during the course of this one), the author's systematic breakdown of the essentials for creating successful realistic plays and screenplays effectively demystifies the process of creative writing. Egri, who formulated his thoughts about "a well-made play" during its heyday (the 1940s and '50s), places a premium on an exhaustive analysis of characters and discussion of their psychological motivations. The writer is exhorted to find a premise to explore and to discover which characters will most effectively demonstrate this thesis, then is shown how most effectively to place them into conflict with each other. Conflict itself is also discussed, particularly how to create scenarios in which the crisis develops at a pace that feels unforced and natural. While Egri's view of the well-made play has little space for either the spare musings of Beckett and Pinter or the conscious excesses of non-narrative and other experimental writing, it nonetheless remains an essential text for writers drawn to realistic drama, and to any writer interested in the fundamental motivations of human behavior. <i>--John Longenbaugh</i><b>Lajos Egri</b> (1888-1967) was born in Hungary and founded the Egri School of Writing in New York City in the 1930s. In addition to writing books, he spent his life writing and directing plays in both the United States and Europe, as well as writing screenplays for the film industry. <p></p></p><h2>The Loney</h2><p><b>Winner of the Costa First Novel Award&nbsp;<br> A Best Book of the Year, London <i>Times</i> and <i>Daily Mail</i><br> An Exceptional Novel, <i>Sunday Times </i><br> Best Book of the Year, British Book Industry Awards<br> A Best Summer Book, <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The terrors of this novel feel timeless .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

The tables get turned when Hamilton interviews Koryta on the <i>The Ridge</i> page.</p> <p><strong>Koryta:</strong> <i>Misery Bay</i> opens with relentless good cheer--a frigid night, a corpse dangling from a tree. And, back for the first time in a few years, Alex McKnight. Tell us a little about how it felt to be back with him from the writer's perspective.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> It was great to be back, for the simple reason that it had been so long. Almost five years between books! I hadn&#x2019;t planned on being away from the series for so long, but I sorta ended up getting lost at sea there for a while. A standalone that just about kills you will do that.</p> <p><strong>Koryta:</strong> You opened your career with seven straight Alex McKnight novels, and then followed with two standalones, including last year's <i>The Lock Artist</i>, which just won the Edgar for best novel. Did you always know you were going to return to Alex, or was there a time when you thought you were done?</p> <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> I knew that, after <i>A Stolen Season</i>, the last McKnight book, I really needed to take a break. And that Alex needed a break, too--as strange as that may sound to say about a fictional character. I just couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to drag him out of his cabin, into some new sort of trouble again. Does that make any sense?</p> <p><strong>Koryta:</strong> Absolutely! I know you don't write from an outline. What's something from <i>Misery Bay</i> that stands out as a favorite unanticipated development?</p> <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> I guess that would have to be the relationship that develops between Alex and his old nemesis, Chief Roy Maven. I knew they&#x2019;d have to unlikely allies in this book, but actually having them together for so long, I was surprised to see how well that worked. I wouldn&#x2019;t call them good friends or anything at this point, but they definitely had to come to a new understanding about each other.</p> <p><strong>Koryta:</strong> We both got our publishing start through the St. Martin's Press/Private Eye Writers of America contest. So tell me: who's your all-time favorite fictional detective, and who is a newer discovery that you're excited about?</p> <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> All-time favorite fictional detective? Still has to be Lawrence Block&#x2019;s Matt Scudder, I think. As far as a newer discovery... If you&#x2019;re talking about a new private eye, I honestly don&#x2019;t know of one right now. The genre has been down a little bit lately, and I haven&#x2019;t read anything new and great for while. (Maybe this year&#x2019;s contest winner? There&#x2019;s always hope!)</p> <p><strong>Koryta:</strong> As I look over my shoulder at the Steve Hamilton section in my bookshelf, I can't help but notice some repeated themes in the titles: winter, north, ice, cold, wind. And, oh yeah, misery. Be honest: are you really that inspired by cold weather, or is this evidence that you desperately want to move to the tropics?</p> <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> To me, when I think about &#x201c;hardboiled&#x201d; or &#x201c;noir,&#x201d; I think about cold. When just going outside to your car is an act of courage, that has to say something about you already, right? I know that Raymond Chandler&#x2019;s idea of hardboiled was a sun-baked street in Los Angeles, but for me there&#x2019;s just something about a frozen lake and a cold wind that will turn you inside-out.</p> <p><strong>Koryta:</strong> I&#x2019;m in sun-drenched Los Angeles right now and it&#x2019;s tough to argue that point. This is your 10th novel. It has been 13 years since your Edgar-winning debut, <i>A Cold Day in Paradise</i>. What has changed in your perspective and approach to writing in that time and throughout those books?</p> <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> Well, it doesn&#x2019;t get any easier. Or at least it shouldn&#x2019;t, or else you&#x2019;re doing it wrong. And I&#x2019;m STILL waiting for a great idea for a book to come floating by and land on my shoulder like a some kind of beautiful butterfly. These authors who have all these great ideas that just come to them out of nowhere, I want to slap them. If I have one sorta half-baked idea that might get me through one chapter, I&#x2019;m lucky.</p> <p><strong>Koryta:</strong> What's next--another Alex or another standalone? Give us a taste.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> The publisher really likes this return to Alex thing, so they want some more of that. More importantly, I&#x2019;m finding it&#x2019;s pretty great to be back in Paradise. So for the next two books, at least, it&#x2019;s Alex McKnight all the way! I know I&#x2019;ll take breaks again and try new things, but it&#x2019;s nice to know I can always to come back to see what he&#x2019;s up to next.</p>STEVE HAMILTON's first novel, <i>A Cold Day in Paradise,</i> won the Private Eye Writers of America/St. Martin's Press Best First Private Eye Novel Contest before becoming a <i>USA Today</i> bestseller and winning both an Edgar and a Shamus Award for Best First Novel. His stand-alone novel, <i>The Lock Artist,</i> was named a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book, received an Alex Award by the American Library Association, and went on to win the Edgar Award for Best Novel, making him only the second author (after Ross Thomas) to win Edgars for both Best First Novel and Best Novel. He attended the University of Michigan, where he won the prestigious Hopwood Award for writing, and now he lives in Cottekill, New York, with his wife and their two children.</p><h2>The Glenstal Book of Daily Prayer: A Benedictine Prayer Book</h2><p><p>Drawing on the rich resources of the Benedictine tradition, <i>The Glenstal Book of Daily Prayer</i> aims to share with Christians everywhere some of that tradition as it is celebrated daily in Glenstal.

If students leave our classrooms not knowing how to move a piece of writing forward, we&#x2019;ve failed them.&nbsp;<i>Revision Decisions</i>&nbsp;will help teachers develop the skills students need in an ever-evolving writing, language, and reading world. Jeff Anderson and Deborah Dean have written a book that engages writers in the tinkering, playing, and thinking that are essential to clarify and elevate writing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Focusing on sentences, Jeff and Deborah use mentor texts to show the myriad possibilities that exist for revision. Essential to their process is the concept of classroom talk. Readers will be shown how revision lessons can be discussed in a generative way, and how each student can benefit from talking through the revision process as a group.&nbsp;<i>Revision Decisions</i>&nbsp;focuses on developing both the writing and the writer. The easy-to-follow lessons make clear and accessible the rigorous thinking and the challenging process of making writing work. Narratives, setup lessons, templates, and details about how to move students toward independence round out this essential book.&nbsp;Additionally, the authors weave the language, reading, and writing goals of the Common Core and other standards into an integrated and connected practice.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The noted language arts teacher James Britton once said that good writing &#x201c;floats on a sea of talk.&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>Revision Decisions</i>&nbsp;supports those genuine conversations we naturally have as readers and writers, leading the way to the essential goal of making meaning.&nbsp;</p><p><p>For the past 25 years, Jeff has worked with writers and teachers of grades, K-12, inspiring them about the power and joy of the writing process. He has written four books for Stenhouse Publishers:&nbsp;<i>Mechanically Inclined</i>,&nbsp;<i>Everyday Editing</i>,&nbsp;<i>10 Things Every Writer Needs to Know</i>&nbsp;and his latest book with Dr. Deborah Dean of BYU&nbsp;<i>Revision Decisions: Talking Through Sentences and Beyond&nbsp;</i>(November 2014). He also has two middle grade novels,&nbsp;<i>Zack Delacruz: Me and My Big Mouth</i>&nbsp;(Sterling, 2015) and&nbsp;<i>Zack Delacruz: Just My Luck</i>&nbsp;(Sterling, October 2016).</p><p>Jeff grew up in Austin, where he learned to love writing through journaling, a bit of positive reinforcement, and writing stories and dramas to entertain his friends on the phone. He wanted to become a teacher early on, but his parents tried to convince him otherwise. "They wanted me to make more money." During an internship visit to a local elementary classroom, he made up his mind. "When I saw those curious eyes, kids raising their hands, asking questions, I lost all track of time and from that moment on, I was a teacher. I want to create environments that feel safe for learners at the elementary, middle, and university levels and during professional development for teachers. Working together we figure out things, surprise each other, find our strengths, and experience the joy it is to be a learner and teacher. We are students and teachers to each other."</p><p>Jeff specializes in writing, revision, and grammar. "I love the ability to spark curiosity and creativity and to support students in finding their voices. That's pure joy." When it comes to his own professional development, he wants to explore things that have meaning to him in the classroom. "I want to find out things I didn't know, be affirmed or reminded of what I do know, and be energized by thinking and action, reflection and application. Since that's what I want, that's what I give teachers. Something they can take, shape, and make their own. Something they can use right now."</p><p>Jeff's first book&nbsp;<i>Mechanically Inclined</i>, came to life from what he didn't know and what he needed to know. "I read, tried things out, played in my head and in my classroom, and read some more, permutating and refining. I thought about what worked and what didn't, as well as what sound pedagogical principles are used in other disciplines."</p><p>His other books also came from his work in his own classrooms and those across the United States. The invitational process&nbsp;<i>Everyday Editing</i>&nbsp;is built around was first shared in workshops until teachers wanted another book on grammar.&nbsp;<i>10 Things&nbsp;</i>was Jeff's chance to share what his experience had taught him are the essential things every writer needs to know and be able to do. In his first collaboration, Jeff and Debbie came together to tackle a sentence combining and its larger effects on revision and writing.</p><p>In his free time, Jeff walks his dogs Carl and Paisley or sits on the deck with his partner Terry. When he's not doing that he reads middle grade novels and his new addiction is nonfiction.</p><br><br><p>Deborah Dean taught junior high and high school in Washington before beginning her work with pre-service teachers at Brigham Young University. She always enjoyed teaching writing and helping her students discover themselves as writers.</p><p>Deborah says that she became a teacher because she wanted to share her passion for reading and writing. "I wanted to help students find abilities they didn't know they had and interests they might not investigate without me encouraging them in&nbsp;those interests."</p><p>She received her bachelor's degree in English from Brigham Young University, her M.Ed. degree from City University (Seattle) and her Ed.D. degree from Seattle Pacific University.</p><p>She currently works with teachers and directs the Central Utah Writing Project.</p><i>&#x201c;</i>Revision Decisions<i> will provide teachers with much-needed tools to facilitate the teaching of revision in a way that will make it stick with their students.

The body that is with us all our lives is always changing. We are quite literally not who we were years, weeks, or even days ago: our cells die and are replaced by new ones at an astonishing pace. The entire body continually rebuilds itself, time and again, using the food and water that flow through us as fuel and as construction material. What persists over time is not fixed but merely a pattern in flux.<br><br>We rebuild using elements captured from our surroundings, and are thereby connected to animals and plants around us, and to the bacteria within us that help digest them, and to geological processes such as continental drift and volcanism here on Earth. We are also intimately linked to the Sun's nuclear furnace and to the solar wind, to collisions with asteroids and to the cycles of the birth of stars and their deaths in cataclysmic supernovae, and ultimately to the beginning of the universe. Our bodies are made of the burned out embers of stars that were released into the galaxy in massive explosions billions of years ago, mixed with atoms that formed only recently as ultrafast rays slammed into Earth's atmosphere. All of that is not just remote history but part of us now: our human body is inseparable from nature all around us and intertwined with the history of the universe.<br></p><p><br>Karel Schrijver, <em>Senior Fellow, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center, California</em>,Iris Schrijver, <em>Professor of Pathology and Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine Pathology Department</em><br><br>Karel Schrijver is a Senior Fellow at Lockheed Martin's Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto, California.

G. Landels describes the technological advances of the Greeks and Romans with erudition and enthusiasm. He provides an important introduction to engineering, writing about power and energy sources, water engineering, cranes, and transportation devises. From aqueducts to catapults, he attempts to envision machines as they may have worked in the ancient world. He then traces the path of knowledge taken by early thinkers&#x2015;including Plato, Pliny, and Archimedes&#x2015;in developing early theories of engineering and physics.</p><p><b>J. G.

Since the majority of the world's data is unlabeled, conventional supervised learning cannot be applied; this is where unsupervised learning comes in. Unsupervised learning can be applied to unlabeled datasets to discover meaningful patterns buried deep in the data, patterns that may be near impossible for humans to uncover.<br><br>Author Ankur Patel provides practical knowledge on how to apply unsupervised learning using two simple, production ready Python frameworks scikit learn and TensorFlow using Keras.

In plane (two dimensional) geometry, they are known as polygons and comprise such figures as triangles, squares, pentagons, etc. In solid (three dimensional) geometry they are known as polyhedra and include such figures as tetrahedra (a type of pyramid), cubes, icosahedra, and many more; the possibilities, in fact, are infinite! H. S. M. Coxeter's book is the foremost book available on regular polyhedra, incorporating not only the ancient Greek work on the subject, but also the vast amount of information that has been accumulated on them since, especially in the last hundred years. The author, professor of Mathematics, University of Toronto, has contributed much valuable work himself on polytopes and is a well-known authority on them. <br>Professor Coxeter begins with the fundamental concepts of plane and solid geometry and then moves on to multi-dimensionality. Among the many subjects covered are Euler's formula, rotation groups, star-polyhedra, truncation, forms, vectors, coordinates, kaleidoscopes, Petrie polygons, sections and projections, and star-polytopes. Each chapter ends with a historical summary showing when and how the information contained therein was discovered. Numerous figures and examples and the author's lucid explanations also help to make the text readily comprehensible. Although the study of polytopes does have some practical applications to mineralogy, architecture, linear programming, and other areas, most people enjoy contemplating these figures simply because their symmetrical shapes have an aesthetic appeal. But whatever the reasons, anyone with an elementary knowledge of geometry and trigonometry will find this one of the best source books available on this fascinating study.</p><p><p><b>H. S. M. Coxeter: Through the Looking Glass <br></b>Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter (1907&#x2013;2003) is one of the greatest geometers of the last century, or of any century, for that matter. Coxeter was associated with the University of Toronto for sixty years, the author of twelve books regarded as classics in their field, a student of Hermann Weyl in the 1930s, and a colleague of the intriguing Dutch artist and printmaker Maurits Escher in the 1950s. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"I'm a Platonist &#x2014; a follower of Plato &#x2014; who believes that one didn't invent these sorts of things, that one discovers them. In a sense, all these mathematical facts are right there waiting to be discovered." </p><p> </p><p>"In our times, geometers are still exploring those new Wonderlands, partly for the sake of their applications to cosmology and other branches of science, but much more for the sheer joy of passing through the looking glass into a land where the familiar lines, planes, triangles, circles, and spheres are seen to behave in strange but precisely determined ways." </p><p> </p><p>"Geometry is perhaps the most elementary of the sciences that enable man, by purely intellectual processes, to make predictions (based on observation) about the physical world. The power of geometry, in the sense of accuracy and utility of these deductions, is impressive, and has been a powerful motivation for the study of logic in geometry." </p><p> </p><p>"Let us revisit Euclid. Let us discover for ourselves a few of the newer results. Perhaps we may be able to recapture some of the wonder and awe that our first contact with geometry aroused." &#x2014; H. S. M.

The book provides fascinating historical background, ranging from the mystical groups that flourished in ancient Judaism in the East, and the medieval schools of Kabbalah in Northern Spain and Southern France, to the widening growth of Kabbalah through the school of Isaac Luria of Safed in the sixteenth century, to the most potent and influential modern Jewish religious movement, Hasidism, and its use of kabbalistic language in its preaching. The book examines the key ancient texts of this tradition, including the Sefer Yezira or "Book of Creation," The Book of Bahir, and the Zohar. Dan explains Midrash, the classical Jewish exegesis of scriptures, which assumes an infinity of meanings for every biblical verse, and he concludes with a brief survey of scholarship in the field and a list of books for further reading.<br><br>Embraced by celebrities and integrated in many contemporary spiritual phenomena, Kabbalah has reaped a wealth of attention in the press. But many critics argue that the form of Kabbalah practiced in Hollywood is more New Age pabulum than authentic tradition. Can there be a positive role for the Kabbalah in the contemporary quest for spirituality?<br><br>In <em>Kabbalah</em>, Joseph Dan debunks the myths surrounding modern Kabbalistic practice, offering an engaging and dependable account of this traditional Jewish religious phenomenon and its impact outside of Judaism.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.<br></p><p><br><strong>Joseph Dan</strong> is the Gershom Scholem Professor of Kabbalah in the Department of Jewish Thought, at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His many books include <em>The Heart and the Fountain: Jewish Mystical Experiences, The Early Kabbalah</em>, and <em>The Teachings of Hasidism</em>. He resides in Jerusalem and in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he is a visiting professor at the Harvard Divinity School.<br><br>"Dan has given us the best concise history of Jewish mysticism.... As a 'very short introduction' to this sublime treasure house, Joseph Dan's book is warmly recommended."--Benjamin Balint, <em>Commentary</em><p></p><br>"This survey of Kabbalah offers deep history in succinct fashion, resulting in a fascinating and highly readable effort."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"In a little more than a hundred pages, Dan races through more than a thousand years of Jewish religious texts, explaining a vast, amorphous body of beliefs and practices that have influenced Freemasons, Hasidim, Carl Jung, New Age gurus and, more recently, Hollywood celebrities. It's quite a performance, carried off with only a few stumbles."--William Grimes, <em>The New York Times</em><p></p><br>"A lucid history and explanation of Kabbalah, covering its key periods, texts, figures, and theories. Dan knowledgeably and expertly untangles the complexity of the tradition, specifically addressing misconceptions by discussing what Kabbalah is and what it is not.... This primer is scholarly yet accessible to the lay reader; it's 'Kabbalah for Dummies' sans the cheeky humor."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Even someone who knows nothing more than the celebrity connection will come away with a nuanced understanding."--<em>Dallas Morning News</em><p></p><br>"Professor Dan is one of the leading scholars of Jewish mysticism in the world today. He combines deep erudition with methodological sophistication and clarity of exposition. He is the ideal person to write a short introduction to the study of the Kabbalah."--Shaye J. D. Cohen, Harvard University<p></p><br>"Culling over fifty years of Kabbalah research, Joseph Dan presents a schematic introduction to Kabbalah, its major periods, personalities, and ideas. This slim volume is a window into the intriguing history of this esoteric wisdom-- its Christian and Islamic influences, the proliferation of Christian Kabbalah, its influence on modern philosophy, and the important periods of Jewish heresy. From the ancient world to New Age spirituality, Dan lucidly covers the key ideas of Kabbalah as they developed over the centuries. Accessible, readable, and informative."--Shaul Magid, Indiana University<p></p><br></p><h2>Skateboarding and the City: A Complete History</h2><p><p>Skateboarding is both a sport and a way of life.

Hopkins and Katt explain that most sales reps take a traditional linear approach to selling, but that the trick in closing is in taking a more creative and circular approach. That's the key.<br><br>It all starts with how the buyer initially says, "No." Too many sales reps don't pay close attention as to how that's presented. Hopkins and Katt point out that "no" may suggest all sorts of other options -- avenues that can eventually lead to the buyer actually saying yes.<br><br>The authors introduce a novel concept called the Circle of Persuasion which offers sales reps a new approach in this potentially tricky process. Along the way, WHEN BUYERS SAY NO details prescriptive steps and even sample dialogues that will instruct and guide sales professionals on how to best cultivate buyer-seller relationships. <br><br>There's particular emphasis on how to establish the kind of rapport that ultimately leads to a successful close.</p><p>Tom Hopkins is the chairman and founder of the renowned sales training organizationTom Hopkins International.

Set in sixteenth-century Hungary during the Ottoman conquests, the colloquy voices the youth's anguish at the impending invasion and the elder's words of solace. More offers a reflection of his own dire circumstances as well as a powerful statement of his conviction that God is a Christian's only comfort. A penetrating exploration of the fleeting nature of pleasure, the essence of worldly power, and Christ's redemptive power, this book constitutes an enduring legacy of faith.</p><p>Author, philosopher, and&nbsp;scholar Sir Thomas More (1478&#x2013;1535) served as Henry VIII's Lord Chancellor.

So this collection offers a selection of descriptions and tales, often those recorded faithfully by some of the first to put them to paper &#x2013; tales of the gods, creation stories, trickster adventures, animal fables and stories which amuse and teach &#x2013; from Olukun&#x2019;s Revenge, from the Yoruba people of west Africa, to The Story of the Glutton, from the Bantu-speaking peoples of east Africa, all brought together with the aim of providing an insight into the boundless and vibrant world of African myth.

Brown, one of the 930 original Tuskegee pilots, whose dramatic wartime exploits and postwar professional successes contribute to this extraordinary account.</b><br><br><i>Keep Your Airspeed Up: The Story of a Tuskegee Airman </i>is the memoir of an African American man who, through dedication to his goals and vision, overcame&nbsp;the despair of racial segregation to great heights, not only as a military aviator, but also as an educator and as an American citizen.<br> &nbsp;<br> Unlike other historical and autobiographical portrayals of Tuskegee airmen, Harold H. Brown&#x2019;s memoir is told from its beginnings: not on the first day of combat, not on the first day of training, but at the very moment Brown realized he was meant to be a pilot. He revisits his childhood in Minneapolis where his fascination with planes pushed him to save up enough of his own money to take flying lessons. Brown also details his first trip to the South, where he was met with a level of segregation he had never before experienced and had never imagined possible.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the 1930s and 1940s, longstanding policies of racial discrimination were called into question as it became clear that America would likely be drawn into World War II. The military reluctantly allowed for the development of a flight-training program for a limited number of African Americans on a segregated base in Tuskegee, Alabama. The Tuskegee Airmen, as well as other African Americans in the armed forces, had the unique experience of fighting two wars at once: one against Hitler&#x2019;s fascist regime overseas and one against racial segregation at home.<br> &nbsp;<br> Colonel Brown fought as a combat pilot with the 332nd Fighter Group during World War II, and was captured and imprisoned in Stalag VII A in Moosburg, Germany, where he was liberated by General George S. Patton on April 29, 1945. Upon returning home, Brown noted with acute disappointment that race relations in the United States hadn&#x2019;t changed. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1948 that the military desegregated, which many scholars argue would not have been possible without the exemplary performance of the Tuskegee Airmen.</p><p><b>Harold H. Brown</b> grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota. After completing flight training at the Tuskegee Institute, he served as a combat pilot with the 332nd Fighter Group during World War II. After the war, he joined the Strategic Air Command before earning his PhD and serving as an administrator at what is now Columbus State Community College in Columbus, Ohio<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Marsha S. Bordner</b> is president emeritus at Terra State Community College in Fremont, Ohio. She has spent more than thirty-five years committed to higher education, both as an educator and as an administrator. She earned her PhD in English from the Ohio State University."<i>Keep Your Airspeed Up</i> is a surprise. A very nice one. Not only is it a warm and genuine biography, beginning even before author Harold H. Brown was born, but this book takes readers through a two-pronged fight, both in war and for civil rights, as told through quiet tales of heroes and those who created them . . .Even if you don't consider yourself a World War II buff, this book is more than just that; there's other history here, as well as a biography that will charm you plenty. If that seems like a winner for you, then <i>Keep Your Airspeed Up</i> is a pretty big book."<br> &#x2014;<i>Marco Eagle </i><br><br> &#x201c;A very valuable addition to the available literature on the Tuskegee Airmen from a first-person point of view.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Daniel L.

Here, editors Alan Drengson and Bill Devall provide a comprehensive yet accessible volume of Naess&#x2019;s most groundbreaking and seminal essays, which have remained influential among environmentalists to this day.<br>Drawing from influences as diverse as Eastern religious practices, Gandhian nonviolent direct action, and Spinozan unity systems, Naess&#x2019;s writing calls for cooperative action to protect the earth on which we dwell, encouraging individuals and communities to develop their own distinctive ecosophies.&#x201d;<br>These writings, full of Naess&#x2019;s characteristic enthusiasm, wit, and spiritual fascination with nature, provide a look into the remarkable philosophical underpinnings of his own social and ecological activism, as well as an inspiration for all those looking to follow in his footsteps. This is an essential anthology from one of modern environmentalism&#x2019;s most important and relevant voices.</p><p>[A] well-written, thought provoking set of works from a man who is a national hero of sorts in Norway, but has yet to really make his mark here in the United States.

One of the reasons it is still a mystery is because it is also the only peacetime attack on a US naval vessel that, to this day, has never been investigated by the Congress of the United States.<br> The USS Liberty was a 455-foot, 10,150-ton electronic intercept spy ship, originally a standard-design Victory Ship--a more evolved version of the World War II Liberty Ships--which were built as supply ships, not intended for direct fighting. The Liberty had been converted to an Auxiliary Technical Research Ship (AGTR), known colloquially as a "spy ship," first deployed in 1965; its top speed was only 18 knots.<br><br> Yet the Liberty's fate, one of the most enigmatic, unresolved military mysteries of all time, is, paradoxically at its core, quite clear-cut and undisputed. The basic facts generally accepted by all are that, on the fourth day of the Six Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors (Egypt, Syria and Jordan), the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) savagely attacked the U.S. spy ship, the USS Liberty.<br><br> On the warm, sunny-bright day of June 8, 1967, starting at about 6:00 a.m., at least twelve, possibly thirteen Israeli aircraft of different types began surveilling the Liberty, some of which were only 1,000 feet or less in altitude, apparently to photograph and "map" her for later targeting purposes. The precision of the later attack could only have been accomplished through such pre-planning, specifically identifying the priority targets, starting with the gun mounts to render the ship defenseless, followed by all of the forty-five different radio antennae and related transmitting equipment. . Beginning just before 2:00 p.m., three unmarked French-built Mirage III-C swept-wing fighter jets, without warning, settled into a triangular formation, aimed straight at the Liberty and proceeded to bore down on the ship in a fast low-level attack that began with rockets targeted at the four gun mounts and heat-seeking missiles aimed at the communications gear, with their warmed transmitters. . When the attack was over, thirty-four men were dead and one hundred seventy-four were injured to varying degrees, some near death.<br><br> Unlike all other books ever written about the tragic attack - none of which provide a satisfactory explanation of what really caused it - Remember the Liberty! examines it in complete context of how it was positioned there by Johnson himself, for the very purpose of being attacked, and sunk, with every one of the 294 men on board going to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. His purpose was to use that event - while blaming Egyptian President Gamal Nasser for the attack - as a pretext for joining Israel in the war, even at the risk of igniting World War III with the Soviet Union. This book provides the only realistic explanation for why Lyndon Johnson did what he did, and why, in the heat of battle, he intervened with his Navy officers who were determined to rescue the Liberty and ordered them to recall the squadrons of fighter jets they had already dispatched - twice, 90 minutes apart - for that purpose.<br><br>When the heroic crew saved the ship from sinking, it stopped Johnson's plan to join Israel in the war and thereby saved the world from certain nuclear conflagration. It also prevented his strategy of entering what he felt would be a "popular war" (unlike his other one in Vietnam) in order to give him a better chance to be reelected president the following year. When that failed to materialize, so did his reelection campaign; ten months later he was forced to announce his decision to not re-run for the office that he had always considered his destiny.</p><p>The story of the attack on the USS<i> Liberty</i> is one of the most explosive and hidden secrets in U.S. history -- one that has never been previously told -- because the truth was too incriminating for the then-president, Lyndon B. Johnson. &nbsp;The facts were withheld and replaced with lies which he created to hide his own treasonous conduct. No previous book on the subject has come close to providing a realistic explanation of &nbsp;how it could occur because none has ever documented the fact that he was the primary instigator of that attack, and even the larger plan for Israel to attack its neighbors in what became the Six Day War. The veil of secrecy he designed has lasted fifty years and this book is the first of its kind to remove it.<br><i></i><i></i><i></i>After the botched plan to sink the <i>Liberty&nbsp;</i>was executed, thanks to its heroic crew, the ship refused to sink even after being hit by a torpedo, leading the attack to be cancelled and a massive cover-up invoked. Including severe threats for the crew members to "keep their lips sealed." That cover-up is barely still in place, and has now been completely exposed.&nbsp;<i></i><i></i><i>Remember the Liberty!</i>&nbsp;examines the over-arching, larger story behind the attack on the ship and how Johnson had designed it as another false flag" operation intended to secure him another landslide election win the following year, just like he had done in 1964 with another false flag operation -- the faked "attack" by North Vietnam gunboats on two U.S. Navy destroyers at the Gulf of Tonkin. Much of the book was written by three of the survivors of the attack. &nbsp; Finally, the truth is being told as never before and the real story revealed.<b>Phillip Nelson</b> grew up in Indiana,&nbsp;studied at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, and served in the Peace Corps in Brazil.

The author of the multi-million-selling <em>Conversations with God</em> series places the question squarely before our world in another blockbuster book that could move our species closer to true spiritual revolution on the Earth, changing humanity&#x2019;s future for the better, forever. In direct and spiritually challenging language, Walsch here exposes the many ways in which he believes that humanity completely misunderstands God. He then describes in clear terms how the world could change overnight if humans accurately comprehended what God is, what God wants, who they are in relation to that, and to each other. Walsch calls this the &#x201c;Missing Data&#x201d; which, if ever embraced and acted on by our species, would create a spiritual revolution across the globe, bringing humanity both inner and outer peace at last. Does anybody care why our species has been such a failure? Does anybody imagine it has not been?

Easy to read and follow steps go down to even the smallest detail in the design and construction of basic archery bows. Learn to craft fine wooden bows without huge investment in equipment and materials, and without being bound by location and limited workspace. Learn to construct: A classic target flat bow, an English Longbow suitable for hunting, and even your own strings and arrows for traditional and primitive archery.</p><p>&nbsp;I originally started writing<i> The Backyard Bowyer as a way to learn the bowyer's craft. As I built bows and taught myself through trial and error, the concept of the book changed. It has been a long road, but&nbsp;fueled by my passion for traditional&nbsp;archery, I have never tired from it. I hope that this book allows anyone interested in building bows to just go ahead and do it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My new and final mission for this book is to teach how to build basic&nbsp;bows from inexpensive materials and with a minimum of investment in tools and space. This book will not show how to make an enduring wooden bow that will last generations, nor to build a bow that will be your lifelong companion. My goal is to simply allow you to build bows, to have your first bow in your hands. I want youto make your own mistakes, conquer your own challenges, and grow as a craftsperson. There are&nbsp;many books on bowmaking theory and history, and while&nbsp;this knowledge is very powerful, the&nbsp;best way to learn something is to do it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that with the basic steps outlined in this book, you will break the boundary between knowing and doing. Build your first bow, and then the theories will begin to make sense. I almost didn't start bowmaking at all, even&nbsp;after I had become hooked on traditional archery and wanted to make my own bows.&nbsp;The first&nbsp;book on bows I had ever read&nbsp;was the great <em>Traditional Bowyer's Bible</em>, which at once filled me with wonder and abstract concepts that I could not fully grasp.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first bow was a disaster, the product of too much knowledge and not enough practice. I had tried to put too many ideas into that bow, and it snapped under the strain. I had tried so hard to follow rules that I didn't understand, to try and make that first bow the best it could be. I nearly gave up, nearly threw it away and moved on with my life. I hadn't even touched my father's old Ben Pearson fiberglass recurve for months after my failure, but with that bow in hand, I was ready to try bow-making one last time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's when I stumbled across another book. <em>The Archery Handbook</em>, written in the forties, was truly a godsend. It was a simple book, with simple instructions on building the type of bows that were mainstream back then. My second bow was very simple, and although it lacked many qualities of a fine wooden bow, it worked. That was good enough for me. Soon I had another, then another. They got better as I struggled with not having a teacher or a good guide to show me what to do.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I wrote <em>the Backyard Bowyer</em>. It is a guide that will help you build a bow that will work. The methods and materials are far from traditional, but&nbsp;are easy enough to master and obtain to&nbsp;allow anyone, regardless of workspace, income, or level of interest to craft a wooden bow. And that's all you need to get started. Once you&nbsp;experience the thrill of firing an arrow from your very first bow, feel the wood flex beneath your fingertips, hear the thud of the arrow, you will know you've&nbsp;created something special. My only adive to you, don't ever let that fire stop burning.<br><br><b>-Nicholas Tomihama <em>The Backyard Bowyer</em></b></i>Nicholas Tomihama was born in Honolulu, where he lived until graduating high school. From there he went to Hilo on the island of Hawaii (the Big Island) to study business management at the University of Hawaii at Hilo.<br>&nbsp;Even before going to college, he had a knack for making things and working with his hands, perhaps coming from his father who was a jeweler and general jack-of-all-trades. In highschool, Nicholas made hand-turned wooden pens, collected coins, fossils, and toyed around with his father's hunting bow.<br>&nbsp;In Hilo, Nicholas was exposed to the party life and turned away from it, instead passing his time exploring the island and getting to his Hawaiian heritage. He began researching and studying native hawaiian crafts, carving bone hooks, crafting woven slings, and other hawaiian arts.<br>&nbsp;After becoming more interested with craft than education, Nicholas returned to Oahu without a degree and married his highschool sweetheart, who had kept up with him in a long-distance relationship for the duration of his stay in Hilo.<br>&nbsp;Nicholas now lives on Oahu with his wife and young son, Levi. He is an artist who makes hand-crafted bows and arrows and enjoys the sport of archery.

Jenkins gives a detailed account about the procedures performed on the President&#x2019;s remains. What he learned that night led him to believe there was a conspiracy in the murder of the 35th President of the United States and caused him to undertake his own personal journey into the labyrinth of the assassination.</p><p><b>James Curtis Jenkins</b> was born in 1943. After enlisting in the United States Navy he won a place at the Medical Technology School that was part of Bethesda Naval Hospital, where John F. Kennedy's body was taken the day of his assassination. Along with fellow students, he was asked to assist in the autopsy of Kennedy. <b>William Law's</b>&nbsp;decades of research on the Kennedy assassination has appeared in more than 30 books, including Douglas Horne&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Inside the Assassination Records Review Board</i>.

Vanessa Benjamin carries forth Blackstone&#39;s tradition of matching the gender of the narrator to the author, rather than to the main character. When the genders of hero and narrator don&#39;t match, one gets a more old-fashioned sense of being read to, rather than hearing a performance. Benjamin relies strictly on the drama inherent in the text, subtly underscoring it with pacing and emphasis. Her minimalistic vocal shifts when reading dialogue are initially distracting, but they quickly fade into the background, as she means them to do. S.F.

In a recent profile, <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> paid tribute to her amazing ability to combine the classical and the modern, the mundane and the surreal, in a body of work that is sure to endure.<br><br>In <b>Men in the Off Hours</b>, Carson offers further proof of her tantalizing gifts. Reinventing figures as diverse as Oedipus, Emily Dickinson, and Audubon, Carson sets up startling juxtapositions: Lazarus among video paraphernalia, Virginia Woolf and Thucydides discussing war, Edward Hopper paintings illuminated by St. Augustine. And in a final prose poem, she meditates movingly on the recent death of her mother. With its quiet, acute spirituality and its fearless wit and sensuality, <b>Men in the Off Hours</b> shows us a fiercely individual poet at her best.</p><p>Yes, consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds--and minor poets. The major ones tend to operate in a trough-and-peak pattern, producing a dozen lesser works for every masterpiece. Still, Anne Carson pushes this tendency to extremes, and nowhere more markedly than in <i>Men in the Off Hours</i>, which contains some of the best and worst lyrics of her entire career.<p> First, the good news: Nobody has written more acutely about perception--about the chaotic collision of our senses with the real world--since the glory days of Wallace Stevens. Not that Carson echoes the airborne rhetoric of her great predecessor. Her fractured, zigzagging lines deliberately avoid the kind of gravity that was his trademark, and she likes to deflect the grand manner by ratcheting her diction upward (into Delphic utterance) or downward (into baby talk, if the baby happens to be Gertrude Stein). Still, like Stevens, she makes us think about <i>how</i> we think. She dislikes any attempt to remove cognition from its rustling Heraclitean framework. No wonder she ends up scolding taxidermy freak John James Audubon, whose point-and-shoot portraiture rubs her the wrong way: "In the salons of Paris and Edinburgh // where he went to sell his new style / this Haitian-born Frenchman / lit himself // as a noble rustic American / wired in the cloudless poses of the Great Naturalist. / They loved him // for the 'frenzy and ecstasy' / of true American facts." We comprehend things only in flux and, as Carson explains in "Essay on What I Think About Most," by mistake: </p><blockquote> ...what we are engaged in when we do poetry is error,<br> the willful creation of error,<br> the deliberate break and complication of mistakes<br> out of which may arise<br> unexpectedness. </blockquote> Now for the bad news: <i>Men in the Off Hours</i> includes too ample a serving of Carson's weaker, semiprecious work--short lyrics in which she bends over backwards for an antipoetic poetic effect (if such a thing is possible). "Epitaph: Europe" is precisely the kind of freeze-dried surrealism she should avoid. And the spitballs this classicist fires at television in a piece like "TV Men: Thucydides in Conversation with Virginia Woolf on the Set of <i>The Peloponnesian War</i>" are truly puzzling. Why blame the tube for our cultural sins, particularly when the average <i>NYPD Blue</i> rerun contains more experiential fiber than most contemporary poetry? Still, Carson's blazing successes easily overshadow her failures. And those who have found her too recondite, too forbidding, need only take a look at the concluding poem, "Appendix to Ordinary Time." This elegy to the poet's mother is touching, emotionally direct, and completely original: an instant (to use a phrase Carson would probably loathe) classic. <i>--James Marcus</i>"Brilliant and irrepressible, Carson takes liberties with high irony and deep emotion."<br>-- <i>Booklist</i><br><p>"Immediate, intimate, and astute...Read this book now, and you'll have the pleasure of knowing that you were present at the arrival of a truly great poet of the 21st century."<br>-- <i>Time Out</i><br></p><p>"Carson's demanding style has been among the decade's most intriguing: critics with little else in common look forward to her inimitable and argumentative poems...Incorporates a brace of unusual genres--quick verse-essays, epitaphs and epigrams, predictions and 'oracles,' pseudo-bibliographical 'drafts' and 'fragments,' verse-portraits (the Biblical Lazarus, a circus 'Flatman'), invented proverbs, and extremely free translations...Striking."<br>-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br></p><p>"Everything welcomes Carson, she welcomes everything. . . The most instantly penetrating of contemporary poets, she's a principle of vividness visited worldsharp upon the world. She goes at once to where the living is . . . There's good reason that Carson's reputation has soared to that of the half-dozen most admired contemporary American (sic.) poets. She's tremendously gifted and, without lowering standards, often writes in a middle range between philosophy and lyricism, where many can find her. At the same time, she has a great intellectual and emotional knowledge, a vast habitat, to every bit of which she brings powerful perception and a freshness as startling as a loud knock at the door."<br>--Calvin Bedient, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Practical Christian Theology: Examining the Great Doctrines of the Faith</h2><p>Since first published in 1981, <i>Practical Christian Theology has been a popular resource for both lay readers and academic students of the Bible.

The countless books on the Third Reich and the Holocaust fail even to mention the laws restricting firearms ownership, which rendered political opponents and Jews defenseless. A skeptic could surmise that a better-armed populace might have made no difference, but the National Socialist regime certainly did not think so&#x2014;it ruthlessly suppressed firearm ownership by disfavored groups. </p><p>Gun Control in the Third Reich spans the two decades from the birth of the Weimar Republic in 1918 through Kristallnacht in 1938. The book then presents a panorama of pertinent events during World War II regarding the effects of the disarming policies. And even though in the occupied countries the Nazis decreed the death penalty for possession of a firearm, there developed instances of heroic armed resistance by Jews, particularly the Warsaw ghetto uprising.</p></p><p><b>Stephen P.

Everyone, including advocates of gun controls, should find this pioneering and thought-provoking book essential reading." &#x2014;James B. Jacobs, Warren E. Burger Professor of Law, New York University; author, <i>Can Gun Control Work?</i><br><br>"<i>Gun Control in the Third Reich</i>, Stephen Halbrook's excellent history of gun control in Germany, shows that, motives notwithstanding, removing weapons from the general population always disarms society vis a vis its worst elements. In Germany the authorities tried to deal with the Nazi and Communist mobs that were shaking society's foundations indirectly, by disarming ordinary people. But their cowardice ended up delivering a helpless population to the Nazis' tender mercies. Halbrook's richly documented history leads Americans to ask why those among us who decry violence in our society choose to try tightening the vise on ordinary citizens' capacity to defend themselves rather than to constrain the sectors of society most responsible for the violence." &#x2014;Angelo M. Codevilla, Professor Emeritus of International Relations, Boston University; author, <i>Informing Statecraft, War: Ends and Means</i> (with Paul Seabury), The Character of Nations, and Between <i>the Alps and a Hard Place: Switzerland in World War II</i> and the <i>Rewriting of History</i> <br><br><p>"<i>Gun Control in the Third Reich</i> is a provocative book on what is surely the 'worst case scenario' in the history of gun control and an illuminating meditation on the role that the disarming of the Jews played in the Holocaust." &#x2014;Jonathan Kirsch, author, <i>The Short, Strange Life of Herschel Grynszpan</i><br><br></p><p>"What good would private arms do against a totalitarian state? That won't remain an unanswerable rhetorical challenge for readers of Stephen Halbrook's calm, detailed scholarly book,<i> Gun Control in the Third Reich</i>. As Halbrook shows, Nazi leaders went to great lengths to extend the gun control laws they inherited from the Weimar Republic. They were obsessed with disarming Jews and other designated public enemies. Potential resistance was not only physically disabled. It was morally and psychologically disarmed. Evil then became irresistible in Germany, not because it was fueled by fanaticism but because shielded by fatalism." &#x2014;Jeremy A. Rabkin, Professor of Law, George Mason University School of Law<br><br></p><p>"'The devil is in the details' as the British note. Stephen Halbrook's excellent and deeply researched book,<i> Gun Control in the Third Reich</i>, has revealed the anticipation of Nazi gun control techniques in Weimar attempts to control incipient civil war between Nazis and Communists [...] History does indeed provide important lessons for contemporary debates and Halbrook's important research should inform our contemporary debate on gun control." &#x2014;Steven B.

It provides a timely reminder that self defense and the right to bear arms are fundamental human rights." &#x2014;Robert J. Cottrol, Professor of Law, History, and Sociology and Harold Paul Green Research Professor of Law, George Washington University<br><br>"Even a defense with small arms against a tyrannical regime, if known, can galvanize public opinion which is the ultimate source of all political authority. That is why, as Halbrook authoritatively shows in <i>Gun Control in the Third Reich</i>, the Nazis-despite their massive military force-went out of their way to confiscate even small caliber weapons in Germany." &#x2014;Donald W. Livingston, Professor of Philosophy Emeritus, Emory University<br><br>"For Jews left trembling in their homes, powerless to defend against Nazi Stormtroopers, the right to possess a gun took on special meaning in the 1940's. In Stephen Halbrook's extraordinary book, <i>Gun Control in the Third Reich</i>, the consequence of disarming a population making them vulnerable to imprisonment and annihilation is told with frightening detail. It is a history with poignancy. With gun controllers in our midst today, who either do not understand the Second Amendment or choose to redefine it for their own ends, it would serve them well to read and digest the powerful arguments in this pathbreaking book." &#x2014;Herbert I.

Sneaking out of the Vatican at night, washing the feet of inmates, and taking selfies with young fans is certainly unlike any religious leader we've seen in a while, and some of the religious establishment is uneasy about it. The revitalization Francis is bringing to the Catholic Church is not without precedent, however. Jesus had a similar effect in his day, drawing crowds with his humility, kindness, and wisdom--even as he drew the disapproval of established religious leaders. The things that have brought Francis such media attention are the same things that made Jesus so peculiar and attractive in his day.</p><p> Thoughtful examination of Jesus' example and legacy, as well as an honest look at the similarities and differences between Catholic and Protestant faith, invites reflection on the heart of Christianity and how we relate to our fellow Christians. Readers will discover the power of heartfelt joy, radical love, and passion for justice to shake people out of religious complacency and into dynamic, contagious faith. <i>Jesus, Pope Francis, and a Protestant Walk into a Bar</i> looks at what is universal among Christians, what is unique to Catholics and Protestants, and how all Christians can practice understanding and cooperation across differences. Perfect for individual or group use, discussion questions are also included to encourage further thought and conversation.</p></p><p><p><b>Paul Rock</b> is Senior Pastor of Second Presbyterian Church in Kansas City, Missouri.</p><p><b> Bill Tammeus</b> is the former Faith section columnist for <i>The Kansas City Star</i>.

The exploits of Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street , have been recounted many times in plays, films and musicals, but the origins of the character largely were forgotten for many years. The String of Pearls - the original tale of Sweeney Todd, a classic of British horror - was first published as a weekly serial in 1846-7 by Edward Lloyd, the King of the Penny Dreadfuls. One of the earliest detective stories, it became an important source for Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula, but it was after over 150 years of obscurity that it appeared first in book form in the Wordsworth edition published in 2005. The one great mystery that has surrounded the book is who the author was - or was it possibly the work of more than one man? In his new introduction to this fully revised second edition, Dick Collins, by means of detailed research of contemporary records, has established finally the identity of the creator of this legendary figure. So here is the original story of the terrifying owner of that famous London barber-shop, and the secret recipe for Mrs Lovett s delicious pies...</p><p>The authorship is a bit of a mystery.

Traditionally, artisans use a piece of the rib bone of a cow and a pair of scissors as their only tools for construction. When English settlers founded Christ Church Parish in the late 1600s, they saw a place rich in natural beauty and ideal for harvesting rice, cotton, and indigo. Skilled agricultural laborers were needed, and consequently, South Carolina became the top importer of enslaved West Africans.

In Witchcraft, the tarot is used today as a tool for divination, psychic readings, meditations, personal growth pathworking, and spiritual insight, but what is the origin of the tarot and how did this intriguing set of cards evolve? This mysterious deck of cards began its career as the game of tarocchi in fifteenth-century Italy, recognizable today as the game of Trumps or Whist. Subsequently, the tarot cards have been embraced by people, denounced by Christian clergy, banned by kings, revived by kings, and regulated by laws. Over the centuries, the tarot evolved into today's recognized system of divination, beginning with the writings of an eighteenth-century Mason named Antoine Court de Gebelin and a host of French clairvoyants operating on the premise that the cards were of Egyptian origin. The designs, numbering, interpretations, and reverse interpretations began to take the familiar present-day shape through the efforts of nineteenth-century Ceremonial Magicians. These people were Masons who operated in the secret societies and occult orders popular in the Victorian Age, in particular those of the Grand Order of the Rose Cross and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Many people contributed their special insights on the cards from the eighteenth through nineteenth centuries, and by the early twentieth century the tarot form most familiar in America was that of Arthur Waite, painted by Pamela Coleman Smith, and known as the Rider-Waite deck. <br> <br>Today, the typical deck has seventy-eight cards divided into two parts, with the Major Arcana representing archetypal powers, universal imagery, and cosmic fates, while the Minor Arcana represents the interactions of daily life. The Major Arcana contains twenty-two cards, of which twenty-one are numbered, plus the unnumbered Fool, which is usually assigned the 0. This 0 card may begin or end the deck, depending on your point of view. The ordinary pack of playing cards descends from those of the Minor Arcana, although with only three of the possible five court cards for each suit. The four suits of the Minor Arcana are variously labeled Pentacles, Coins, Disks, and Bells; Swords, Knives, Daggers, and Leaves; Wands, Batons, Rods, and Acorns; or Cups, Cauldrons, Bowls, and Hearts. Depending on the tarot deck, the terms for the suits may vary, but these became in modern playing cards, respectively, the suits of Diamonds, Spades, Clubs, and Hearts. <br> <br>There are a number of opinions on how the tarot came to Europe, but I feel the most plausible is that the Romany Gypsies, migrating from India through eastern Europe and into northern Italy during the Middle Ages, brought the cards with them. Any suggestion that ancient Egyptians used tarot cards results in the uncontrolled raising of an eyebrow since there is no evidence to support this theory. The earliest tarot deck of Europe still in existence with nearly all the original cards (five have been reconstructed) was made in 1450 in Milan for Viscount Sforza, although playing cards are mentioned in writings from 1397 and 1441. This tarocchi deck had no titles or numbers for the distinctive cards that are now identified as the Major Arcana. The Minor Arcana consisted of the four suits containing Kings, Queens, Knights, and Pages as Court Cards; the Aces; and the cards numbered 2 through 10 as pips like modern playing decks, making reverse readings out of the question. In fact, the idea of reverse meanings is a relatively recent invention. The Ace of any suit may be read as a 1, or as a trump card of greater power than a King card, so it may be at home on either end of the four suits of the Minor Arcana, somewhat as the Fool card may be placed on either end of the Major Arcana. <br> <br>All subsequent tarot decks show the influence of the Sforza deck, and examining this deck reveals the evolution away from the earlier Pagan images. There were several aspects of the Goddess Diana and examples of tools from the Etruscan and Roman period, and more contemporary tools, such as a war wagon carrying an enthroned woman and being pulled by golden-winged white horses without reins, and the accouterments of the Medieval street magician. The Diana images were replaced in later renderings by generic females, and the battle wagon became a chariot with unruly teams of horses or sphinxes held in check by the sheer will of a dominant man. The mages controlled the Elementals through intellectual power, and the original's floppy hat evolved into the cosmic lumniscate, while the hourglass of the gentlemanly Old Father Time became the lantern of the monkish Hermit. The Popess, a reminder that a woman was once elected to rule the Church based upon her ability when no one knew her sex, only to be deposed upon discovery, became a less intimidating High Priestess. The Wildman awakening the Earth, a custom still followed in German, Romanian, Austrian, and British villages with variations of the British Morris Dancer tradition, and possibly derived from rites of Dionysus and Bacchus, was changed to the Fool, heedlessly stepping off into danger. The Sun of Apollo, spreading joy and erasing fear, became the Sun of twins or a child on horseback. It is in the many aspects of Diana that most changes took place. Diana releasing the Star of Hope from her open, outstretched hand (the rays of which fall in front of her hand) became a generic woman pouring out waters on land and sea beneath the stars. Diana of Temperance, pouring from one pitcher to another the dark wine that symbolized the blood of the resurrecting God, giving it thus the breath of life, became an angel pouring water between pitchers. Diana of the Moon, standing with her bow in one hand, broken in remorse for accidentally killing Orion with an arrow, holds the waning crescent Moon in her other hand, showing that life passes into death and hence into immortality, for Orion was reborn as a constellation&#x2015;the same one that the Egyptians named after their God of the Underworld, Osiris. This image vanished to become a Moon between towers, bayed at by a wild wolf and a domestic dog. The Tower in the deck is actually erupting, releasing the Star and the Eclipsed Sun in a demonstration of the power of internal enlightenment and passage, but this image evolved into the Lightning-struck Tower, showing outside influence rather than internal inspiration. <br> <br>While a variation of cards was also being used in China, with the contact between China and India it is difficult to determine who influenced whom. Those of India, however, have suits that may be matched to the accouterments of either the image of Shiva as Ardhanari (Shiva as Half Male and Half Female), or that of the Goddess Durga, the Great Goddess. Since the Gypsies came from India and used the cards first in Europe, it seems reasonable to link these two indicators as the predecessors for the European tarot. <br> <br>Very quickly, the cards were adapted to provide the user with a Christian interpretation of the archetypes, and by the eighteenth century the depictions showed the influence of the divination structures reflecting Christian culture and the Jewish Kabbalah that were favored by Ceremonial Magicians. Differences of opinion as to the exact lineage of the tarot continue, with about the only consensus being that the tarot is not of European origin. As instruments of divination, it seems likely that since these cards were in the hands of the Gypsies first, and they have a strong tradition of reading cards, that the origins of divination with the cards may be misplaced in the salons of gentility in Paris. This is supported by the use of the cards for visions or oracles in the sixteenth century, long before being associated with fortunetelling. The difference as I see it between the two terms is that the first uses mediumship and spiritual connection for counseling, while the other relies on fixed meanings for the cards in a manner that does not allow much room for working with the energies indicated. Overall, I do not see the quibbling as vital to the use of the cards today as a tool of mediumship and spiritual guidance, for, in Witchcraft, this is what divination is actually about. <br> <br><b>Modern Tarot Decks <br></b>In the latter part of the twentieth century, depictions on the cards in many new tarot decks returned to Pagan themes, and others related to fantasy worlds and international ethnic archetypes or mythologies. Indeed the proliferation of new decks shows that nearly any taste can be accommodated to the tarot. Most of these decks come with little pamphlets or booklets tucked inside with the interpretations for each card provided. When you go looking for a tarot deck, keep in mind the point of view of the creator of the deck. You may be thrilled with a vampire version of the tarot, or quite frustrated with the images when trying to match the pamphlet descriptions to the scene, or blending both with your usual values for the cards and your own psychic reception. You may be drawn to fairies, unicorns, dragons, or fantasy, but have difficulty relating these images to real-life matters. I have found over the years that I like to have a variety of tarot decks, not only for the beauty of the artwork, but for the sensations they evoke, and that by handling the cards and examining them for their esoteric insights, any deck can become a useful companion. Some of my decks feel best during holidays, others are more attuned to one of the four seasons, and a few are distinctly aligned with the energies of specific people for whom the cards are most often read. <br> <br>I have over fifty tarot decks now, and I use almost all of them&#x2015;almost, because some things are a matter of live and learn, and I have found that despite handling, examination, and ritual dedication, a couple of my decks are so gorgeous and decorative as to be works of art rather than avenues to psychic awareness, so that instead of finding the common thread within, my eyes wander over the swirling designs. I also have heard people complain that a deck may be too overbearing in a theme for them, or so restrictive to a theme as to block psychic input, but other than being drawn to admire the beauty rather than focusing on the reading, I have not found any deck to be impossible to work with. <br> <br>Some typical themes found in tarot decks include following a format of suits structured to fit a set of myths (Celtic, Greek, Norse, Arthurian, etc.); blending cultures and traditions from around the world; and generating the ambiance of Gothic, vampire, fairy, nursery rhyme, feline, wolf, gnome, unicorn, dragon, and other such motifs into a coherent spread matched to the arcanas. There are a number of choices in buying a tarot deck suited to your particular taste and interests, but be aware that there are also decks in which the normal number of cards may be expanded, or that there may be cards absent that are familiar to tarot. A deck may have additional cards for the four Elementals (Earth, Air, Fire, Water), the four Virtues (Hope, Faith, Prudence, and Charity), and even the twelve signs of the Zodiac. The deck with the Virtue cards is curiously missing the High Priestess card, so for me to read with this deck, I substitute Prudence for the Priestess and set the other Virtues aside (which somehow seems appropriate, for if you are prudent, the rest will follow). Elemental cards may seem a bit redundant since Aces are the power cards of the Minor Arcana and double as representatives of the Elementals as well, but each person is different, and you might actually find these useful as guides for timings as with seasons. <br> <br>Since these decks can be quite expensive, ranging from $10.00 to $30.00 or more, you should be prepared to buy with care. Many of the larger bookstore chains, and even some of the smaller independent shops, have a tarot card reference book in which one or two sample cards of the various decks are displayed for your examination. Otherwise, check the bookshelves in the New Age or Metaphysical section of the bookstore and flip through some of the books on tarot so you see images of cards used to illustrate the text and identify the deck of those cards that catch your eye. With care, you should avoid the pitfall of buying a deck that does not work for you. In Europe there have always been many varieties, easily purchased at the shops in the railroad stations that crisscross the countries, with especially prominent displays in the shop windows lining the platforms in front of the rails of the Italian stations. It is wonderful that the different decks so readily accessible in Europe have finally reached across the ocean to America with the Lo Scarabeo collection of tarot decks distributed now by Llewellyn Publications. <br> <br><b>The Meaning of Reading Cards <br></b>The most common reason I hear for reading cards is to "divine the future," but I do not consider this a totally accurate description of what is actually going on. There are states, and counties within states, in the United States that view tarot or other card reading the same as fortune-telling, and require that, in order for you to do public readings, you must have a license indicating that you are an entertainer affiliated with an entertainment corporation or business, or a person of moral character if reading independently, usually with a number of signatures from people who will vouch for your integrity. Again, this is not what card reading means to me. While there are instances of people being mistreated through the use of cards, generally involving turning over large sums of money to the reader to avert a disaster or remove an alleged evil influence, I feel there are sufficient laws in existence to treat such cases the same as any other scam or swindle rather than directing the laws at the process of reading the cards. <br> <br>For me, reading cards&#x2015;be they tarot or regular playing cards&#x2015;is part of the spirituality of the Craft, so much so that even as a child, visions and perceptions used to leap out at me in card games as innocuous as gin rummy and solitaire. The very act of divination in Witchcraft requires a link with the Lunar aspect of the Divine, such as with the Goddess Hecate, Cerridwen, Bendidia (Bendis), Artemis, Diana, or Isis, each of whom is considered a Goddess of Witches. When you read the cards, you are connecting with the energies of the Divine for insight and guidance. You also connect with the Elementals through the process of grounding and centering before a reading, thus aligning your internal energies with those of Nature and the Spirit, while opening your psychic sight for a consultation for yourself or someone else. The cards do not of themselves tell the future, but they offer the reader a focal point through which to access Divine energy and gain visions or interpretations of influences surrounding a particular question or person as illustrated by the cards that are pulled. <br> <br>Before you rush out and buy a tarot deck, you should examine your reasons for using cards at all. If you feel that the cards will tell you all there is to know about a situation and what the future holds, you are missing the true purp...</p><h2>New Anchor Book of Blackwork Embroidery Stitches</h2><p>The Anchor Embroidery Series offers the perfect introduction to popular embroidery techniques.

They may make a lucky bet, realize a sizable profit, and find themselves full of confidence. Their next high-stakes gamble might backfire, not only hitting them in the balance sheet but also taking a mental and emotional toll. Even veteran investors can be caught off guard: a news item may suddenly cause havoc for an industry they&#x2019;ve invested in; crowd mentality among fellow investors may skew the market; a CEO may turn out to be unprepared to effectively guide a company.

Howard is a game designer who notably co-scripted the first three Broken Sword adventure games. He is the author of the novel <i>Johannes Cabal the Necromancer</i>. He lives near Bristol, England, with his wife and daughter.</p>Chapter 1:&nbsp;In which death awaits and a plot is hatched&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condemned cell stank of cats.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no rats and no cockroaches, for which Johannes Cabal--a necromancer of some little infamy--was grateful. But the cost of vermin control was an army of cats who crept in and out of his cell and wandered throughout the dungeons of the HarslausCastle with complete impunity. Even the cell doors had cat flaps cut into them. It was no secret that the warders had a much higher opinion of the animals than they did of the inmates. When Cabal was given his introductory tour--which took the form of beingthrown down the stairs and shouted at--he had been left in no doubt that any harm that he might cause the cats would be returned to him, plus interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now he sat and waited for the authorities to find a window in their very busy schedules to execute him, and he did so covered in cat hair in a cell that countless generations of toms had proudly and extravagantly claimed as their own. Things could probablybe worse but, despite some careful thought, Cabal couldn't put his finger on how. So, instead, he considered how he had come to be in such a circumstance. Strictly, necromancy was the telling of the future by summoning up the spirits of the dead and askingthem searching questions. This, Cabal believed, was a singularly poor way of finding out anything. The dead were moderately strong on history, weak on current events, and entirely useless for discerning what was to come. They were, after all, dead. Still, thatwas the dictionary definition of necromancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, however, it became apparent that necromancy, necromancer, and necromantic were fine words wasted on useless definitions, and the lexicological group consciousness gently slid them over a few notches so that they now pertained to somethinginteresting--i.e., magic involving the dead. This was far more satisfying: summoning up the ghost of Aunt Matilda for an insight into next week's lottery numbers was dull; a maniac with a pointy beard unleashing an army of skeletal warriors, however, was fun.Thus, we see the evolution of a language--and a gratifying sight it is, to be sure. Johannes Cabal had no time for the Aunt Matildas of this world or the next. He fitted neatly into the newer definition of necromancer--he dealt with raising the dead (althoughskeletal warriors he left to those of a more theatrical bent). First and foremost, he considered himself a scientist embarked upon a search for a cure for a terrible disease. Death. This would seem laudable if it were not for his methods, his manner, and hisfailed experiments, the latter tending to hang around the countryside, dismaying the yokels. Even this might have been forgivable--pharmaceutical companies have done worse--if it were not for the bad reputation that the more melodramatic necromancers have giventhe profession. Skeletal warriors are all very well when they're chasing Jason and the Argonauts around on the silver screen, but when they're battering down your door . . . Well, that's a different matter altogether. So the necromancers were all besmirchedwith the same gory brush, and Cabal, who just wanted to be left to his research, found himself in a profession proscribed in the most capital terms. It was very galling. Especially when you got caught.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cabal had been caught trying to check out a book from the library of the Krenz University. The book was in the Special Collection, and Cabal had intended the loan to be of an extended, open-ended sort of period. Anticipating resistance from the libraryauthorities, he had made the loan at half past one in the morning of a national holiday and might have got away with it, too, if it hadn't been for an enormous mastiff that patrolled the corridors and of which his contacts had unaccountably failed to warn him.When the library was reopened, they'd found Cabal pinned down by 180 pounds of overfriendly dog in the reading room, half drowned in slobber. Just out of reach was a well-travelled Gladstone bag that was found to contain an enormous handgun, a collection ofsurgical instruments, a closely written notebook, a padded case holding several sealed test tubes full of murky fluids, and the library's own demy-quarto copy of Principia Necromantica.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody wanted a long, drawn-out trial. In fact, nobody who mattered wanted a trial at all, so Johannes Cabal didn't get one. He was just told that he was going to be executed and taken to Harslaus Castle. That had all been almost a month ago, and Cabalwas getting bored. He knew full well that his execution was unlikely to be any more formal than his sentencing and at any time, probably in the wee small hours, the door would thud open, he'd be manhandled off to some dark cellar, his throat would be cut, andhis twitching cadaver thrown down an oubliette. But there was nothing he could do about it, so why worry? Still, it hadn't happened yet; they were still feeding him with nearly edible food, and the more intelligent cats had long since learned to stay out ofhis cell. So why were they waiting? He had a vague and uncomfortable feeling that somebody somewhere had plans for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it happened just as he'd expected after all, in the wee small hours of the morning. He was awoken by the sound of the cell door being thrown open and, before he could recover his wits, a sack was pulled over his head and he was bundled off down thelabyrinthine corridors. He didn't try to fight; there were at least four of them, of whom even the slightest might be described as "burly." He could only stay calm, wait for any small opportunity to escape, should one arise, and hope that, if all failed, andhe was to die, the entry procedures for Hell had at least been rationalised since his last visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was half dragged, half carried for a short time and then thrown into a chair. The sack was whipped off him and, as he blinked in the hard light, he caught a glimpse of a dour, portly man stropping a cutthroat razor on a leather strap. He had the presenceof mind to be impressed that such clandestine executions were so common that they seemed to have somebody employed to commit them. This sangfroid slipped slightly when brutal hands stripped him of his stinking clothes. Any complaints he might have wished tomake thus provoked were drowned when he was thrown into a tub of soapy water and belaboured with sponges. He was still coughing bubbles when he was dragged out again, held down in the chair, slapped in the face with a quantity of lather, and the portly man--gloweringfiercely--grabbed him by the throat and slashed at him with the razor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cabal stopped struggling immediately. The man slid his eyes sideways to look at the quantity of bristles and soap scum that hung from the blade. He twitched the razor and the scum flew in a discrete body off into the shadows, where it fell with an indistinctplap. His eyes swivelled back to regard Cabal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warm for the time of year, isn't it, sir?" he grated. The razor swept in again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten minutes later, Cabal--cleanly shaven, bathed, and dressed in freshly pressed clothes--regarded himself in the mirror. He stood a shade over six feet tall and, although he'd have preferred his blond hair cut back a little and the suit they'd given himwas a dark grey rather than his habitual black, he wasn't altogether displeased with his appearance. It was sober, and Cabal was a very sober man. "Not bad," he said, running his hand over his chin. "Not bad at all. You're the prison barber, then?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, sir," said the man as he put his razor and strap away. "I'm the executioner. But it pays to have more than one feather in me cap. Good morning."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabal watched him leave with mixed feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feeling more human, Herr Cabal?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabal turned his head to look at the newcomer and instantly suspected that he'd been there the whole time, in the shadows. An educated voice. Cabal sighed inwardly--this was probably going to become political, and politics and politicians bored him immeasurably."No more than usual," he replied. "I gather I am to be released?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You gather incorrectly," said the newcomer, stepping into the light. He was in his late thirties, slim, moustachioed, and beautifully turned out in the uniform of a captain of the Imperial Hussars, the jacket over his shoulders, the busby tucked underhis arm. His bearing and the order hanging at his throat loudly proclaimed "landed aristocracy." He walked to the table upon which Cabal's old clothes lay, swept them to the floor, and perched on the corner. He produced a cigarette case, took one for himself,and then offered the case to Cabal. "Do you smoke, Herr Cabal?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only to be antisocial," replied Cabal, making no move.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hussar smiled, put the case away, and lit his own cigarette. "Do you know who I am?" Cabal shrugged noncommittally. "I am Count Marechal of the Emperor's own bodyguard. Yes?" Cabal had raised a finger of query.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perhaps it's just me being a stickler for nomenclature, but doesn't the title of 'emperor' presuppose some sort of empire? I wasn't aware that Mirkarvia has ever gained so much as an inch of land from its neighbours, excepting that business with the faultytheodolite a few years ago. And that you had to give back."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you an educated man, Herr Cabal. You've never heard of the Mirkarvian Empire and the Erzich Dynasty? You disappoint me."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course I've heard of them, but that was all centuries ago. You can hardly harken back to some medieval golden age as if it happened yesterday." He looked at the count and reconsidered. "Or perhaps you can. My mistake."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count twisted his head as if working a crick out of his neck. "Do you believe in history repeating itself? That what has passed will come again? I do. Names and faces will change, but their r_les will be the same. Wars will be fought with new weaponsand new tactics, but for the same goals and objectives."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabal thought it was nonsense but could see that it might be a very comforting theory to cling to for a third-rate backwater with dust on its laurels. Bearing in mind that if this interview didn't go just so he might well not live much longer, and bearingin mind, too, what a great nuisance that would be, he instead said, "I'm not a historian. I can make no comment."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you disagree. No matter." Something in the way he said it made Cabal think that it was a comment frequently on the count's lips, and that a lot of the people who didn't matter ended up floating out of town facedown. With an effort, he made a stabat diplomacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know my profession. I have to think in the long term. There may be something in what you say. In my own researches, I've noticed repetitive patterns developing down the centuries. But my interest is not history. I've never had the desire to analysethese patterns."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Patterns? Patterns." The count mused for a moment. "Yes, I like that. Patterns forming through time. Destiny, as manifest as geometry. As irrefutable as pi. Yes!" His eyes gleamed oddly as he grinned and started pacing up and down, drawing fiercely onhis cigarette. "Yes!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabal started to have a bad feeling about the count. In his experience, military aristocrats fell into two classes. The great majority were in the army because they liked the uniforms, were unpleasant to their batmen, spent fortunes on moustache wax, anddid it all to appeal to the sort of woman who is envious of a cavalryman's horse. A tiny minority, however, were in uniform because they had plans, military plans. And a minority of this minority actually had the wits to do something about it, too. Whateverelse Count Marechal was--mad, for instance--he was also intelligent. Thus, despite his characteristic impatience with the rest of humanity, he let Marechal pursue his train of thought to its conclusion, or at least until he ran out of cigarettes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marechal threw the fag end to the floor and crushed it out beneath the heel of his gleaming boot, taking its successor from the case even as he did so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm at the mercy of a demented chain-smoker, thought Cabal. Oh, happy day. "Mirkarvia has plans, Herr Cabal. Great plans. The Mirkarvian Empire is not just a footnote of history. It is a blueprint for the future."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabal remembered what little he could about the excesses of the Mirkarvian Empire and thought this was a future only Mirkarvians could enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In ten days' time the emperor, Antrobus II, will make an announcement to the people in Victory Square from the balcony of the palace. He will tell them that the time for living in the shadow of our neighbours is over, that foreign spies and agents willno longer be tolerated within our borders, that our climb back towards greatness starts now. At the same time, the secret police will move against known spies and their sympathisers. Their corruption of this country's spirit will cease immediately, and patriotshall work with patriot to ensure that-- Am I boring you?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabal finished yawning. "My apologies. My sleep was disturbed. So, you wish to turn your country into a police state and eliminate any dissent. You're not the first, and you certainly won't be the last."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You disapprove."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care. People are cattle. Do as you will, it's your country. I'm just wondering where I fit into your plans."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're focussed. I like that. I respect clear thinkers. These dissident factions have poisoned the people's minds. We must act quickly or it will be too late."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A revolution."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A rebellion. Civil war. Which is, of course, what our enemies want. I . . . we cannot permit that to happen. The emperor's announcement will nip these rebellious movements in the bud. The police actions will remove the possibility of their reoccurrence.Then we can get on with making destiny manifest. But there is a small problem."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, thought Cabal. Now we come to the crux of it. &nbsp; Count Marechal looked at the ceiling for a moment, frowning slightly as he tried to couch his next words as best he could. Finally, he said, "The emperor is...</p><h2>The Story of Silver: How the White Metal Shaped America and the Modern World</h2><p><p><b>How silver influenced two hundred years of world history, and why it matters today</b></p><p>This is the story of silver&#x2019;s transformation from soft money during the nineteenth century to hard asset today, and how manipulations of the white metal by American president Franklin D. Roosevelt during the 1930s and by the richest man in the world, Texas oil baron Nelson Bunker Hunt, during the 1970s altered the course of American and world history. FDR pumped up the price of silver to help jump start the U.S. economy during the Great Depression, but this move weakened China, which was then on the silver standard, and facilitated Japan&#x2019;s rise to power before World War II. Bunker Hunt went on a silver-buying spree during the 1970s to protect himself against inflation and triggered a financial crisis that left him bankrupt.</p><p>Silver has been the preferred shelter against government defaults, political instability, and inflation for most people in the world because it is cheaper than gold. The white metal has been the place to hide when conventional investments sour, but it has also seduced sophisticated investors throughout the ages like a siren.

These autobiographical stories display a mix of nostalgia and philosophical insight, written in a simple yet profound style looking back on a life's path that led Sentsov to become an internationally renowned dissident artist.<br><br>Sentsov's charges seemingly stem from his opposition to Russia's invasion and occupation of eastern Ukraine where he lived in the Crimea. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison in August 2015 on spurious terrorism charges after he was kidnapped in his house and put through a grossly unfair trial by a Russian military court, marred by allegations of torture. Many of the stories included here were read during international campaigns by PEN International, the European Film Academy, and Amnesty International, among others, to support the case for Sentsov across the world. Sentsov's final words at his trial, "Why bring up a new generation of slaves?" have become a rallying cry for his cause. He spent 145 days on hunger strike in 2018 to urge the Russian authorities to release all Ukrainians unfairly imprisoned in Russia, an act of profound courage that contributed to the European Parliament's awarding him the prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought <br><br>Sentsov remains in a prison camp in Russia. It is the publisher's hope this book, published in collaboration with PEN Ukraine, contributes to his timely release.</p><p>Oleg Sentsov is a Ukranian filmmaker and writer from Crimea, best known for his 2011 film Gamer. Sentsov was arrested in May 2014 in Crimea on suspicion of &#x201c;plotting terrorist acts,&#x201d; after participating in the EuroMayden demonstrations that led to the overthrow of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and helping deliver supplies to trapped Ukrainian troops during Russia&#x2019;s occupation of Crimea. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, causing an outcry by international human rights groups who condemned his imprisonment as a fabrication by the Russian government in an attempt to silence dissent, and calling for investigations into reports of torture and witness coercion. In 2017 he was given the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award. Sentsov&#x2019;s work includes several scripts, plays, and essays, as well as two short films, A Perfect Day for Bananafish and The Horn of the Bull. In May of 2018, he went on a hunger strike to protest the incarceration of Ukrainian political prisoners in Russia. <br><br>Dr. Uilleam Blacker is an academic and translator specializing in Ukrainian, Polish and Russian literature.

This is the reason why&nbsp;Life Went on Anyway&nbsp;is a must-read testimony of the indomitable human spirit that is beyond the reach of fascist regimes.

Dee is a lifelong resident of Illinois and is active online. Visit her at [www.deehenderson.com].If timing is everything, Henderson has it in spades as she launches the second novel in her inspirational suspense/romance series Uncommon Heroes, spotlighting military maneuvers in the Middle East. Navy Lt. Grace "Gracie" Yates is a tough, blue-eyed brunette who has a passion for flying harrowing missions. She's on the radar screen of Air Force Maj. Bruce "Striker" Stanton, who is looking for a long-term relationship despite his and Gracie's military careers, which separate them for long stretches. Henderson avoids mushy romantic cliches almost to a fault her characters are chaste, even by conservative standards, and Bruce and Gracie's first kiss is as lukewarm as old dishwater. But fresh touches of humor mixed with hair-raising rescue scenes keep readers involved, and there's enough Scripture and God talk to please the CBA market. The characterizations are wonderfully done, right down to Bruce's elderly hound dog, Emily, although overlong stretches of dialogue dilute the quality of some of the writing. The pace is often mired in incomprehensible military jargon ("She'd been given vectors to a KC-135 tanker on angels 12 as a backup, but there wasn't a bright billboard to tell her where it was in its pattern"), but readers can bail themselves out by using the glossary provided, which will be well-thumbed by the final page. Henderson's military themes and her strong, career-minded female characters are fairly original for the CBA market, and this latest installment should help build steam for the series. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>A Gentle &amp; Quiet Spirit - Discover the Truth about These Misunderstood Qualities</h2><p>Many Christian women face a dilemma in embracing the biblical teaching in 1 Peter 3:4 about a gentle and quiet spirit being of great worth to God.

Its roll call of storytellers includes cultural giants like Shakespeare, Defoe, and Dickens, and an innumerable host of writers of all sorts who sought to capture the essence of the place. <br><br> Acclaimed historian Jerry White has collected some twenty-six stories to illustrate the extraordinary diversity of both London life and writing over the past four centuries, from Shakespeare&#x2019;s day to the present. These are stories of fact and fiction and occasionally something in between, some from well-known voices and others practically unknown. Here are dramatic views of such iconic events as the plague, the Great Fire of London, and the Blitz, but also William Thackeray&#x2019;s account of going to see a man hanged, Thomas De Quincey&#x2019;s friendship with a teenaged prostitute, and Doris Lessing&#x2019;s defense of the Underground. This literary London encompasses the famous Baker Street residence of Conan Doyle&#x2019;s Sherlock Holmes and the bombed-out moonscape of Elizabeth Bowen&#x2019;s wartime streets, Charles Dicken&#x2019;s treacherous River Thames and Frederick Treves&#x2019;s tragic Elephant Man. Graham Greene, Jean Rhys, Muriel Spark, and Hanif Kureishi are among the many great writers who give us their varied Londons here, revealing a city of boundless wealth and ragged squalor, of moving tragedy and riotous joy.</p><p>Jerry White is Visiting Professor in History at Birkbeck, University of London, and&nbsp;a leading social historian of modern London. He is the author of the critically acclaimed trilogy<i> London in the Eighteenth Century: A Great and Monstrous Thing</i>;<i> London in the Nineteenth Century</i>; and <i>London in the Twentieth Century: A City and Its People.</i>Preface<br><br>London has the greatest literary tradition of any city in the world. Its roll-call of story-tellers includes cultural giants who changed the way that people thought about writing, like Shakespeare, Defoe and Dickens. But there has also been an innumerable host of writers who have sought to capture the essence of London and what it meant for the people who lived there or were merely passing through. They found a city of boundless wealth and ragged squalor, of moving tragedy and riotous joy; and they faithfully transcribed what they saw and felt in the stories they told of London town.<br><br>There have been many previous collections of London short stories, both from a single author and from many hands. This collection is distinctively different in two ways. First, and reflecting the long heritage of London writing, the stories here span four centuries from around 1600 to the pre- sent day. Such a long chronological scope gives an insight into the changing preoccupations of Londoners and London writers over that time; and into some of the continuities &#x2013; trauma both public and private, the never-ending struggle against adversity in the giant city, and the ceaseless stimulation of its delights. Second, I have selected stories that are both fictional and factual. That again reflects the diversity of London writing and the need for the city&#x2019;s writers to live by their pens in a range of media, with short stories, novels and journalism prominent among them.<br><br>In exploring this terrain I&#x2019;ve constructed a mix of the familiar and the unusual. Even where authors are expectedly present, notably Dickens, say, or Thackeray, I have presented them in a guise that will be unfamiliar to many &#x2013; as metropolitan journalists. There will be some, like &#x2018;R. Andom&#x2019; (Alfred Walter Barrett), a witty chronicler of London sub- urban life, who deserve to be better known and others, like Arthur Conan Doyle, whose names have long been known the whole world over. And there will be others still whose names have been lost to us but whose stories have seized the imagination of subsequent generations, like Sir Frederick Treves who &#x2018;rescued&#x2019; the Elephant Man from a fairground freak-show and recalled the moment with extraordinary vividness many years after.<br><br>A similarly contrasting list of writers and stories might have been effortlessly devised to fill many more volumes than this, so rich has London&#x2019;s literary canon grown over the centuries. But while having to make some difficult choices I hope to have devised a collection that will prove as diverse and stimulating as the city that gave these stories their inspiration.<br><br>JERRY WHITE</p><h2>Cognitive Surplus: How Technology Makes Consumers into Collaborators</h2><p><b>The author of the breakout hit <i>Here Comes Everybody</i> reveals how new technology is changing us for the better. </b> <br><br> In his bestselling <i>Here Comes Everybody</i>, Internet guru Clay Shirky provided readers with a much-needed primer for the digital age.

We're flanked on both sides by a jumble of walled, two-story mud-brick buildings, with Iraqi gunmen concealed behind windows, on rooftops and in alleyways, shooting at us with machine guns, AK rifles and the odd rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). Though it's nearly five in the afternoon, a sandstorm has plunged the town into a hellish twilight of murky red dust. Winds howl at fifty miles per hour. The town stinks. Sewers, shattered from a Marine artillery bombardment that ceased moments before we entered, have overflowed, filling the streets with lagoons of human excrement. Flames and smoke pour out of holes blasted through walls of homes and apartment blocks by the Marines' heavy weapons. Bullets, bricks, chunks of buildings, pieces of blown-up light poles and shattered donkey carts splash into the flooded road ahead.</p><p>The ambush started when the lead vehicle of Second Platoon-the one I ride in-rounded the first corner into the town. There was a mosque on the left, with a brilliant, cobalt-blue dome. Across from this, in the upper window of a three-story building, a machine gun had opened up. Nearly two dozen rounds ripped into our Humvee almost immediately. Nobody was hit; none of the Marines panicked. They responded by speeding into the gunfire and attacking with their weapons. The four Marines crammed into this Humvee-among the first American troops to cross the border into Iraq-had spent the past week wired on a combination of caffeine, sleep deprivation, tedium and anticipation. For some of them, rolling into an ambush was almost an answered prayer.</p><p>Their war began several days ago, as a series of explosions that rumbled across the Kuwaiti desert beginning at about five in the morning of March 20. The Marines, who had been sleeping in holes dug into the sand twenty kilometers south of the border with Iraq, sat up and gazed into the empty expanse, their faces blank as they listened to the distant thundering. They had eagerly awaited the start of war since leaving their base at Camp Pendleton, California, more than six weeks earlier. Spirits couldn't have been higher. Later, when a pair of Cobra helicopter gunships thumped overhead, flying north, presumably on their way to battle, Marines pumped their fists in the air and screamed, "Yeah! Get some!"</p><p>Get some! is the unofficial Marine Corps cheer. It's shouted when a brother Marine is struggling to beat his personal best in a fitness run. It punctuates stories told at night about getting laid in whorehouses in Thailand and Australia. It's the cry of exhilaration after firing a burst from a .50-caliber machine gun. Get some! expresses, in two simple words, the excitement, the fear, the feelings of power and the erotic-tinged thrill that come from confronting the extreme physical and emotional challenges posed by death, which is, of course, what war is all about. Nearly every Marine I've met is hoping this war with Iraq will be his chance to get some.</p><p>Marines call exaggerated displays of enthusiasm-from shouting Get some! to waving American flags to covering their bodies with Marine Corps tattoos-"moto." You won't ever catch Sergeant Brad Colbert, the twenty-eight-year-old commander of the vehicle I ride in, engaging in any moto displays. They call Colbert "The Iceman." Wiry and fair-haired, he makes sarcastic pronouncements in a nasal whine that sounds like comedian David Spade. Though he considers himself a "Marine Corps killer," he's also a nerd who listens to Barry Manilow, Air Supply and practically all the music of the 1980s except rap. He is passionate about gadgets: He collects vintage video-game consoles and wears a massive wristwatch that can only properly be "configured" by plugging it into his PC. He is the last guy you would picture at the tip of the spear of the invasion forces in Iraq.</p><p>Now, in the midst of this ambush in a nameless town, Colbert appears utterly calm. He leans out his window in front of me, methodically pumping grenades into nearby buildings with his rifle launcher. The Humvee rocks rhythmically as the main gun on the roof turret, operated by a twenty-three-year-old corporal, thumps out explosive rounds into buildings along the street. The vehicle's machine gunner, a nineteen-year-old Marine who sits to my left, blazes up the town, firing through his window like a drive-by shooter. Nobody speaks.</p><p>The fact that the enemy in this town has succeeded in shutting up the driver of this vehicle, Corporal Josh Ray Person, is no mean feat. A twenty-two-year-old from Missouri with a faintly hick accent and a shock of white-blond hair covering his wide, squarish head-his blue eyes are so far apart Marines call him "Hammerhead" or "Goldfish"-Person plans to be a rock star when he gets out of the Corps. The first night of the invasion, he had crossed the Iraqi border, simultaneously entertaining and annoying his fellow Marines by screeching out mocking versions of Avril Lavigne songs. Tweaking on a mix of chewing tobacco, instant coffee crystals, which he consumes dry by the mouthful, and over-the-counter stimulants like ephedra-based Ripped Fuel, Person never stops jabbering. Already he's reached a profound conclusion about this campaign: that the battlefield that is Iraq is filled with "fucking retards." There's the retard commander in the battalion, who took a wrong turn near the border, delaying the invasion by at least an hour. There's another officer, a classic retard, who has spent much of the campaign chasing through the desert to pick up souvenirs-helmets, Republican Guard caps and rifles-thrown down by fleeing Iraqi soldiers. There are the hopeless retards in the battalion-support sections who screwed up the radios and didn't bring enough batteries to operate the Marines' thermal-imaging devices. But in Person's eyes, one retard reigns supreme: Saddam Hussein. "We already kicked his ass once," he says. "Then we let him go, and he spends the next twelve years pissing us off even more. We don't want to be in this shithole country. We don't want to invade it. What a fucking retard."</p><p>Now, as enemy gunfire tears into the Humvee, Person hunches purposefully over the wheel and drives. The lives of everyone depend on him. If he's injured or killed and the Humvee stops, even for a moment in this hostile town, odds are good that everyone will be wiped out, not just the Marines in this vehicle, but the nineteen others in the rest of the platoon following behind in their Humvees. There's no air support from attack jets or helicopters because of the raging sandstorm. The street is filled with rubble, much of it from buildings knocked down by the Marines' heavy weapons. We nearly slam into a blown-up car partially blocking the street. Ambushers drop cables from rooftops, trying to decapitate or knock down the Humvee's turret gunner. Person zigzags and brakes as the cables scrape across the Humvee, one of them striking the turret gunner who pounds on the roof, shouting, "I'm okay!"</p><p>At least one Marine in Colbert's Humvee seems ecstatic about being in a life-or-death gunfight. Nineteen-year-old Corporal Harold James Trombley, who sits next to me in the left rear passenger seat, has been waiting all day for permission to fire his machine gun. But no chance. The villagers Colbert's team had encountered had all been friendly until we hit this town. Now Trombley is curled over his weapon, firing away. Every time he gets a possible kill, he yells, "I got one, Sergeant!" Sometimes he adds details: "Hajji in the alley. Zipped him low. I seen his knee explode!"</p><p>Midway through the town, there's a lull in enemy gunfire. For an instant, the only sound is wind whistling through the Humvee. Colbert shouts to everyone in the vehicle: "You good? You good?" Everyone's all right. He bursts into laughter. "Holy shit!" he says, shaking his head. "We were fucking lit up!"</p><p>Forty-five minutes later the Marines swing pickaxes into the hard desert pan outside of the town, setting up defensive positions. Several gather around their bullet-riddled Humvees, laughing about the day's exploits. Their faces are covered with dust, sand, tar, gun lubricant, tobacco spittle and sewer water from the town. No one's showered or changed out of the bulky chemical-protection suits they've been wearing for ten days. Since all mirrors and reflective surfaces have been stripped from their Humvees to make the vehicles harder to detect, most of the men haven't seen themselves since crossing the border. Their filthy faces seem to make their teeth shine even whiter as they laugh and hug one another.</p><p>The platoon's eldest member, thirty-five-year-old Gunnery Sergeant Mike "Gunny" Wynn, walks among the Marines, grabbing their heads and shaking them like you would when playing with a puppy. "All right!" he repeats in his mild Texas accent. "You made it, man!"</p><p>"Who's the fucking retard who sent us into that town?" Person asks, spitting a thick stream of tobacco juice, which catches in the wind and mists across the faces of several of his buddies standing nearby. "That sure tops my list of stupid shit we've done."</p><p>Trombley is beside himself. "I was just thinking one thing when we drove into that ambush," he enthuses. "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. I felt like I was living it when I seen the flames coming out of windows, the blown-up car in the street, guys crawling around shooting at us. It was fucking cool."</p><p>Culturally, these Marines would be virtually unrecognizable to their forebears in the "Greatest Generation." They are kids raised on hip-hop, Marilyn Manson and Jerry Springer. For them, "motherfucker" is a term of endearment. For some, slain rapper Tupac is an American patriot whose writings are better known than the speeches of Abraham Lincoln. There are tough guys among them who pray to Buddha and quote Eastern philosophies and New Age precepts gleaned from watching Oprah and old kung fu movies. There are former gangbangers, a sprinkling of born-again Christians and quite a few guys who before entering the Corps were daily dope smokers; many of them dream of the day when they get out and are once again united with their beloved bud.</p><p>These young men represent what is more or less America's first generation of disposable children. More than half of the guys in the platoon come from broken homes and were raised by absentee, single, working parents. Many are on more intimate terms with video games, reality TV shows and Internet porn than they are with their own parents. Before the "War on Terrorism" began, not a whole lot was expected of this generation other than the hope that those in it would squeak through high school without pulling too many more mass shootings in the manner of Columbine.</p><p>But since the 9/11 attacks, the weight of America's "War on Terrorism" has fallen on their shoulders. For many in the platoon, their war started within hours of the Twin Towers falling, when they were loaded onto ships to begin preparing for missions in Afghanistan. They see the invasion of Iraq as simply another campaign in a war without end, which is pretty much what their commanders and their president have already told them. (Some in the military see the "War on Terrorism" merely as an acceleration of the trend that started in the 1990s with Somalia, Haiti, Kosovo: America cementing its role as global enforcer, the world's Dirty Harry.) In Iraq the joke among Marines is "After finishing here, we're going to attack North Korea, and we'll get there by invading Iran, Russia and China."</p><p>They are the first generation of young Americans since Vietnam to be sent into an open-ended conflict. Yet if the dominant mythology that war turns on a generation's loss of innocence-young men reared on Davy Crockett waking up to their government's deceits while fighting in Southeast Asian jungles; the nation falling from the grace of Camelot to the shame of Watergate-these young men entered Iraq predisposed toward the idea that the Big Lie is as central to American governance as taxation. This is, after all, the generation that first learned of the significance of the presidency not through an inspiring speech at the Berlin Wall but through a national obsession with semen stains and a White House blow job. Even though their Commander in Chief tells them they are fighting today in Iraq to protect American freedom, few would be shaken to discover that they might actually be leading a grab for oil. In a way, they almost expect to be lied to.</p><p>If there's a question that hangs over their heads, it's the same one that has confronted every other generation sent into war: Can these young Americans fight?</p><p>As the sky turns from red to brown in the descending dust storm outside the town the Marines have just smashed apart, their platoon commander, a twenty-five-year-old lieutenant named Nathaniel Fick, leans against his Humvee, watching his men laugh. Lieutenant Fick, a Dartmouth graduate who joined the Marines in a fit of idealism, shakes his head, grinning. "I'll say one thing about these guys," he says. "When we take fire, not one of them hesitates to shoot back. In World War Two, when Marines hit the beaches, a surprisingly high percentage of them didn't fire their weapons, even when faced with direct enemy contact. They hesitated. Not these guys. Did you see what they did to that town? They fucking destroyed it. These guys have no problem with killing."</p><p>Several Marines from Colbert's vehicle gather around Corporal Anthony Jacks, a twenty-three-year-old heavy-weapons gunner. Jacks is six foot two, powerfully built, and has a smile made unforgettable by his missing two front teeth (shot out in a BB-gun fight with his brother when he was sixteen). The Marines' nickname for him is "Manimal," not so much in tribute to his size but because of his deep, booming voice, which, when he yells, is oddly reminiscent of a bellowing farm animal. The platoon credits him with pretty much saving everyone's life during the ambush. Of the four heavy-weapons gunners in the platoon, Manimal alone succeeded in destroying the enemy's prime machine-gun position across from the mosque. For several minutes his buddies have been pounding him on the back, recounting his exploits. Howling and laughing, they almost seem like Johnny Knoxville's posse of suburban white homies celebrating one of his more outrageously pointless Jackass stunts. "Manimal was a fucking wall of fire!" one of them shouts. "All I seen was him dropping buildings and blowing up telephone poles!"</p><p>"Shut up, guys! It ain't funny!" Manimal roars, pounding the side of the Humvee with a massive paw.</p><p>He silences his buddies. They look down, some of them suppressing guilty smiles.</p><p>"The only reason we're all laughing now is none of us got killed," Manimal lectures them. "That was messed up back there."</p><p>It's the first time anyone has seriously raised this possibility: that war is not fun, that it might, in fact, actually suck.</p><p>In the coming weeks, it will fall on the men in this platoon and their battalion to lead significant portions of the American invasion of Iraq. They belong to an elite unit, First Reconnaissance Battalion, which includes fewer than 380 Marines. Outfitted with lightly armored or open-top Humvees that resemble oversized dune...</p></p><h2>Mother Teresa&#39;s Lessons of Love and Secrets of Sanctity</h2><p>A moving first-hand account of Mother Teresa and her work, written by someone who worked by her side. As an idealistic young volunteer, author Susan Conroy spent a summer serving in one of Mother Teresa's orphanages and in the Home for the Dying. "In a city where I found hell on earth," she says, "I also found each day a deep sense of peace and incredible happiness." <br><br>It was an experience that changed her life forever. She learned why Mother Teresa had found real joy in working with the poorest of the poor. Along the way, she took striking photographs that have never been seen before now - photographs that show Mother Teresa at her everyday best. This is an account you won't soon forget, told with simple and loving directness by an eyewitness.</p><p>Susan Conroy made her first trip to Calcutta to work with Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity in 1986. In 1987, at the request of Mother Teresa herself, Susan spent two weeks in the Order's convent in the South Bronx, New York, in contemplation of the religious life. During these two weeks, a time she calls "the most profoundly meaningful experience of my life, " Susan came to know Saint Th&amp;eacuter&amp;egravese of Lisieux, who has had as great an impact on Susan's life as Mother Teresa. Susan did not enter the Order, but in 1991, during Lent, she once again returned to Calcutta to work with the Sisters among the dying destitutes. <br><br>She and Mother Teresa kept up their correspondence until Mother's death in 1997. Today, in addition to her work as a tax specialist, Susan translates the works of Saint Th&amp;eacuter&amp;egravese of Lisieux from French into English for several publishing houses. Mother Teresa's Lessons of Love and Secrets of Sanctity is Susan's first book.&#34;She was more amazing than I ever imagined she would be!&#34;</p><h2>The Marys of the Bible: The Original #MeToo Movement</h2><p>The #MeToo movement is a global phenomenon. <br> Several Christian organizations have been engaging with issues of abuse against women in places like Africa and Asia. Much of this happens among internally displaced or external refugees. <br> <br> I was reared in a New Delhi slum, and saw much of the horrors of human trafficking among the low caste and outcaste people among whom I lived. <br> <br> These kinds of atrocities against girls and women&#x2014;internally displaced refugees&#x2014;rightly raises much anger. Are there solutions?<br> <br> My students and leaders of several organizations have asked me to write a biblical response to issues raised by the #MeToo movement and the global horror of sexual trafficking of girls and women. <br> <br> This book provides a biblical response to issues raised by the #MeToo movement&#x2014;questions that I have had for many years, going back to my childhood days in that New Delhi slum. <br> <br> My thesis is that women experienced these abuses in ancient societies in very heinous ways. This is seen clearly in ancient Sumerian, Egyptian, and Roman etc. religions. I argue that the Bible sets out to counter attitudes and religious practices of sexual abuse against women. <br> <br> The Bible is the original #MeToo movement.</p><p>Boaz Johnson is Professor of Biblical and Theological Studies at North Park University, Chicago, Illinois.

It was a long time coming. For twenty long years Marie Monsen prayed for revival in China. She had heard reports of how God&#x2019;s Spirit was being poured out in abundance in other countries, particularly in nearby Korea; so she began praying for funds to be able to travel there in order to bring back some of the glowing coals to her own mission field. But that was not God&#x2019;s way. The still, small voice of God seemed to whisper, &#x201c;What is happening in Korea can happen in China if you will pay the price in prayer.&#x201d; Marie Monsen took up the challenge and gave her solemn promise: &#x201c;Then I will pray until I receive.&#x201d; The Awakening is Miss Monsen&#x2019;s own vivid account of the revival that came in answer to prayer. Leslie Lyall calls her the &#x201c;pioneer&#x201d; of the revival movement&#x2014;the handmaiden upon whom the Spirit was first poured out. He writes: &#x201c;Her surgical skill in exposing the sins hidden within the Church and lurking behind the smiling exterior of many a trusted Christian&#x2014;even many a trusted Christian leader&#x2014;and her quiet insistence on a clear-cut experience of the new birth set the pattern for others to follow.&#x201d; The emphasis in these pages is on the place given to prayer both before and during the revival, as well as on the necessity of self-emptying, confession, and repentance in order to make way for the infilling of the Spirit. One of the best ways to stir ourselves up to pray for revival in our own generation is to read the accounts of past awakenings, such as those found in the pages of this book. Surely God is looking for those in every generation who will solemnly take up the challenge and say, with Marie Monsen, &#x201c;I will pray until I receive.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>The Toybag Guide to Basic Rope Bondage (Toybag Guides)</h2><p>A portable fingertip guide to the basics of binding your sweetie! Rope is inexpensive, portable, flexible, and &#34;one size fits all,&#34; so why bother with expensive single-function restraints? Jay Wiseman, world-famous author of &#34;SM 101&#34; and &#34;Jay Wiseman&#39;s Erotic Bondage Handbook,&#34; will guide you through the foundations, knots and positions you need. Soon you&#39;ll find yourself creating safe, sexy limb bondage, spreadeagles, hogties and more.</p><p>Jay Wiseman has over 35 years of experience in BDSM and was one of the early pioneers and builders of the BDSM community in the San Francisco area. He continues to be heavily involved, both in his local area and nationally, as an SM author, educator, mentor, workshop leader, video producer, expert witness, and activist. Jay holds a first-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do, and is a former ambulance crewman and recipient of the highest Red Cross commendation for emergency action. He is the author of three other books about BDSM and bondage."What do you mean you want to tie me up while we have sex??? I thought I knew you! How can you even think that way???"<br><br>The above is not too different from the reaction I got the first time that I ever asked a woman if I could tie her up while we had sex. Candidly, part of me could understand why she felt so concerned. Keep in mind this conversation happened back in about 1970, when things like bondage were almost unheard of, and very, very taboo. The hippie era was very much still in progress, and "peace, love, and bondage" was not one of our mantras.<br><br>Fortunately, since then we've come a very long way in becoming accepting of more forms of sex play. Dr. Alex Comfort, in his wonderful book The Joy of Sex, did a lot to help the situation. This book was first published in 1972 and I got my copy in 1973. When I was able to show a potential sex partner the "bondage" section in that wonderful book, it did a lot to help her entertain the thought that mixing in some bondage with our sex life was at least an option that could be considered by a sane person. Oh, and some of my partners took me up on the idea -- with growing enthusiasm as they got to know it.<br><br>Today, things are better. Surveys of college students have shown that up to 40% of them have at least experimented with bondage, spanking, and other BDSM-related activities. Today, if you ask someone if you can tie them up during sex, or be tied up with them, you may get a no, but you're much less likely to get an "I'm shocked that you could even ask!" reaction. (Of course, you have a decent chance of getting an enthusiastic "Sure!" as well.)<br><br>Today, a large percentage of people understand that bondage, if done in a consensual erotic context and with reasonable safety, can add a rich dimension of erotic enjoyment to someone's sex life.<br><br>Given that reality, let's assume that you've asked the question and you've gotten a "Maybe. Tell me more about what you have in mind" reply. Well, what do you have in mind? If you want your partner to be happy with the outcome (and, by the way, also happy with you), here are some suggestions.</p><h2>Deck the Halls</h2><p>In their first acclaimed work of collaboration, Mary Higgins Clark, the Queen of Suspense, and her daughter, bestselling author Carol Higgins Clark, create an exciting and entertaining story of a holiday kidnapping. <br> <br> <b><i>Deck The Halls</i></b> <br> <br> Three days before Christmas, Regan Reilly, the dynamic young sleuth featured in the novels of Carol Higgins Clark, accidentally meets Alvirah Meehan, Mary Higgins Clark's famous lottery winner and amateur detective, at a New Jersey dentist's office.

Her website is CarolHigginsClark.com.from <b><i>Thursday, December 22nd</i></b> <p>Regan Reilly sighed for the hundredth time as she looked down at her mother, Nora, a brand-new patient in Manhattan's Hospital for Special Surgery. "And to think I bought you that dopey crocheted rug you tripped on," she said.</p> <p>"You only bought it. I caught my heel in it," the well-known mystery writer said wanly. "It wasn't your fault I was wearing those idiotic stilts."</p> <p>Nora attempted to shift her body, which was anchored by a heavy plaster cast that reached from her toes to her thigh.</p> <p>"I'll leave you two to assess the blame for the broken leg," Luke Reilly, owner of three funeral homes, husband and father, observed as he hoisted his long, lean body from the low bedside armchair. "I've got a funeral to go to, a dentist's appointment, and then, since our Christmas plans are somewhat altered, I guess I'd better see about buying a tree."</p> <p>He bent over and kissed his wife. "Look at it this way: you may not be gazing at the Pacific Ocean, but you've got a good view of the East River." He and Nora and their only child, thirty-one-year-old Regan, had been planning to spend the Christmas holiday on Maui.</p> <p>"You're a scream," Nora told him. "Dare we hope you'll arrive home with a tree that isn't your usual Charlie Brown special?"</p> <p>"That's not nice," Luke protested.</p> <p>"But it's true." Nora dismissed the subject. "Luke, you look exhausted. Can't you skip Goodloe's funeral? Austin can take care of everything."</p> <p>Austin Grady was Luke's right-hand man. He had handled hundreds of funerals on his own, but the one today was different. The deceased, Cuthbert Boniface Goodloe, had left the bulk of his estate to the Seed-Plant-Bloom-and-Blossom Society of the Garden State of New Jersey. His disgruntled nephew and partial namesake, Cuthbert Boniface Dingle, known as C.B., was obviously bitter about his meager inheritance. After viewing hours yesterday afternoon, C.B. had sneaked back to the casket where Luke had found him stuffing rotted bits of house plants in the sleeves of the pin-striped designer suit the fastidious Goodloe had chosen as his last outfit.</p> <p>As Luke came up behind C.B., he heard him whispering, "You love plants? I'll give you plants, you senile old hypocrite. Get a whiff of these! Enjoy them from now until Resurrection Day!"</p> <p>Luke had backed away, not wanting to confront C.B., who continued to vent verbal outrage at the body of his less-than-generous uncle. It was not the first time Luke had heard a mourner telling off the deceased, but the use of decaying foliage was a first. Later, Luke had quietly removed the offensive vegetation. But today, he wanted to keep an eye on C.B. himself. Besides, he hadn't had a chance to mention the incident to Austin.</p> <p>Luke considered telling Nora about the nephew's bizarre behavior, but then decided not to go into it. "Goodloe's been planning his own funeral with me for three years," he said instead. "If I didn't show up, he'd haunt me."</p> <p>"I suppose you should go." Nora's voice was sleepy, and her eyes were starting to close. "Regan, why don't you let Dad drop you off at the apartment? The last painkiller they gave me is knocking me out."</p> <p>"I'd rather hang around until your private nurse gets here," Regan said. "I want to make sure someone is with you."</p> <p>"All right. But then go to the apartment and crash. You know you never sleep on the red-eye flight."</p> <p>Regan, a private investigator who lived in Los Angeles, had been packing for the trip to Hawaii when her father phoned.</p> <p>"Your mother's fine," he began. "But she's had an accident. She broke her leg."</p> <p>"She broke her leg?" Regan had repeated.</p> <p>"Yes. We were on our way to a black tie at the Plaza. Mom was one of the honorees. She was running a little late. I rang for the elevator..."</p> <p>One of Dad's not very subtle ways of getting Mom to hurry up, Regan thought.</p> <p>"The elevator arrived, but she didn't. I went back into the apartment and found her lying on the floor with her leg at a very peculiar angle. But you know your mother. Her first question was to ask if her gown was torn."</p> <p>That would be Mom, Regan had thought affectionately.</p> <p>"She was the best-dressed emergency-room patient in the history of the hospital," Luke had concluded.</p> <p>Regan had dumped her Hawaii clothes out of the suitcase and replaced them with winter clothes suitable for New York. She barely made the last night flight from Los Angeles to Kennedy, and once in New York had paused only long enough to drop off her bags at her parents' apartment on Central Park South.</p> <p>From the doorway of the hospital room, Luke looked back and smiled at the sight of the two women in his life, so alike in some ways with their classic features, blue eyes, and fair skin, but so different in others. From the Black Irish Reillys, Regan had inherited raven black hair, a throwback to the Spaniards who had settled in Ireland after their Armada had been destroyed in battle with the British. Nora, however, was a natural blonde, and at five feet three inches was four inches shorter than her daughter. At six feet five, Luke towered over both of them. His once-dark hair was now almost completely silver.</p> <p>"Regan, I'll meet you back here at around seven," he said. "After we cheer your mother up, we'll go out and have a good dinner."</p> <p>He caught Nora's expression and smiled at her. "You thrive on the urge to kill, honey. All the reviewers say so." He waved his hand. "See you girls tonight."</p> <p>It was a commitment Luke would not be able to keep.</p> <p>Across town, apartment 16B at 211 Central Park South was in the process of being decorated for Christmas. "Deck the halls with boughs of holly," Alvirah Meehan sang, off-key, as she placed a miniature wreath around the framed picture of Willy and herself accepting the $40 million lottery check that had changed their lives forever.</p> <p>The picture brought back vividly that magical evening three years ago, when she'd been sitting in their tiny living room in Flushing, Queens, and Willy had been half asleep in his old club chair. She had been soaking her feet in a pail of warm water after a hard day of cleaning Mrs. O'Keefe's house when Willy came home, really bushed, from repairing a burst pipe that had sent showers of rusty water on the newly pressed clothes at Spot-Free Dry Cleaners down the block. Then the announcer on television began to read the winning lottery numbers.</p> <p>I sure look different now, Alvirah thought, shaking her head as she examined the picture. The brassy red hair that for so many years she had dyed herself in the bathroom sink had been transformed by Madame Judith, to a soft golden red with subtle shadings. The purple polyester pants suit had long ago been banished by her classy friend, Baroness Min Von Schreiber. Of course, her jutting jaw was the same, a product of God's design when he molded her, but she'd gotten down from a size sixteen to a trimmer size fourteen. There was no question about it -- she looked ten years younger and a thousand times better now than in the old days.</p> <p>I was sixty then and looked like I was pushing seventy. Now I'm sixty-three and don't look a day over fifty-nine, she told herself happily. On the other hand, she decided, looking at the picture, even dressed in that bargain-basement blue suit and skinny little tie, Willy managed to look handsome and distinguished. With his shock of white hair and vivid blue eyes, Willy always reminded people of the late, legendary Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tip O'Neill.</p> <p>Poor Willy, she sighed. What bad luck that he feels so rotten. Nobody should be stuck with a toothache during the Christmas season. But Dr. Jay will fix him up. Our big mistake was to get involved with that other guy when Dr. Jay moved to New Jersey, Alvirah thought. He talked Willy into getting a dental implant even though it hadn't worked last time, and it's been killing him. Oh, well, it could be worse, she reminded herself. Look what happened to Nora Regan Reilly.</p> <p>She had heard on the radio that the suspense author, who happened to be her favorite writer, had broken her leg the evening before in her apartment in the very next building. Her high heel had caught in the fringe of a rug, Alvirah mused -- the same kind of thing that happened to Grandma. But Grandma wasn't wearing high heels. She had stepped on a wad of bubble gum in the street, and when the fringe of the rug stuck to the bottom of her orthopedic sneakers, she went sprawling.</p> <p>"Hi, honey." Willy was coming down the hall from the bedroom. The right side of his face was swollen, and his expression was instant testimony to the fact that the troublesome implant was still killing him.</p> <p>Alvirah knew how to cheer him up. "Willy, you know what makes me feel good?"</p> <p>"Whatever it is, share it right away."</p> <p>"It's knowing that Dr. Jay will get rid of that implant, and by tonight you'll be feeling much better. I mean, aren't you better off than poor Nora Regan Reilly, who'll be hobbling around on crutches for weeks?"</p> <p>Willy shook his head and managed a smile. "Alvirah, can I never have an ache or a pain without you telling me how lucky I am? If I came down with the bubonic plague, you'd try to make me feel sorry for somebody else."</p> <p>Alvirah laughed. "I suppose I would at that," she agreed.</p> <p>"When you ordered the car, did you allow for holiday traffic? I never thought I'd be worried about missing a dentist appointment, but today I am."</p> <p>"Of course I did," she assured him. "We'll be there long before three. Dr. Jay squeezed you in before he sees his last patient. He's closing early for the holiday weekend."</p> <p>Willy looked at his watch. "It's only a little after ten. I wish he could see me this minute. What time is the car coming?"</p> <p>"One-thirty."</p> <p>"I'll start to get ready."</p> <p>With a sympathetic shake of her head, Alvirah watched her husband of forty-three years disappear back into the bedroom. He'll be feeling a thousand percent better tonight, she decided. I'll make some nice vegetable soup for dinner, and we'll watch the tape of <i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i> I'm glad we delayed our cruise until February. It will be good to have a quiet, at-home Christmas this year.</p> <p>A...</p></p><h2>50 Concepts for a Critical Phenomenology</h2><p><p>Phenomenology, the philosophical method that seeks to uncover the taken-for-granted presuppositions, habits, and norms that structure everyday experience, is increasingly framed by ethical and political concerns. Critical&nbsp;phenomenology foregrounds experiences of marginalization, oppression, and power in order&nbsp;to identify and transform common experiences of injustice&nbsp;that render &#x201c;the familiar&#x201d; a site of oppression for many. In <i>Fifty Concepts for a Critical Phenomenology</i>, leading scholars present fresh readings of classic phenomenological topics and introduce newer concepts developed by feminist theorists, critical race theorists, disability theorists, and queer and trans theorists that capture aspects of lived experience that have traditionally been neglected. By centering historically marginalized perspectives, the chapters in this book breathe new life into the phenomenological tradition and reveal its ethical, social, and political promise. This volume will be an invaluable resource for teaching and research in continental philosophy; feminist, gender, and sexuality studies; critical race theory; disability studies; cultural studies; and critical theory more generally.</p></p><p><b>GAIL WEISS</b> is a professor of philosophy at George Washington University.<br><br><b>ANN V. MURPHY</b> is an associate professor of philosophy at the University of New Mexico.<br><br><b>GAYLE SALAMON</b> is a professor of English and gender and sexuality studies at Princeton University."Anyone who questions the vitality of contemporary phenomenology as a site of radical questioning will find the perfect antidote in <i>Fifty Concepts for a Critical Phenomenology</i>. The rich variety of marginalized perspectives represented here is a valuable corrective to so many works of philosophy that have gone before." &#x2014;Robert Bernasconi, author of <i>How to Read Sartre</i><br> &nbsp;<br><br>"An invaluable resource. Not only does it offer a clear overview of key texts and figures both within the center and the periphery of the phenomenological tradition, but it also stands as a crucial critical intervention in the practice of phenomenology itself. It challenges us take seriously the &#x2018;infinite task&#x2019; of better understanding the very ways and means whereby we understand the world and our role in it. It shows, in other words, that rigorous phenomenology must be &#x2018;critical,&#x2019; and that critical phenomenology demands that we leave behind the comfort of tradition.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michael J. Monahan, author of <i>The Creolizing Subject: Race, Reason, and the Politics of Purity</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Fifty Concepts</i> may just be the best introductory text I&#x2019;ve read. Clearly written essays by some of the best minds around articulate compelling connections between phenomenology&#x2019;s traditional concerns (embodiment, experience, perception, e.g.) and crucial contemporary issues (immigration, disability, race, gender identity, queerness, e.g.). Individually and together, the essays demonstrate just how critical phenomenology is to philosophy and to our contemporary world. Highly recommended!&#x201d; &#x2014;Ellen T.

He shows how a deeper appreciation of our children's emotions offers parents a new understanding of their children's development and better solutions to the problems in their lives. <br><br>Barish offers advice to parents on how we can restore more joyfulness and pride in our relationships with our children and how we can help children bounce back from disappointment and defeat. He shows how we can repair family relationships that have been damaged by frequent anger and resentment and how we can preserve our children's idealism and their concern for others-how we can raise children who feel good about themselves and also care about the needs and feelings of others. <br><br>Barish also offers advice on how to solve problems of daily family life-establishing rules and limits, doing homework and going to sleep, winning and losing at games, our children's reluctance to talk to us, their tantrums and lack of motivation, and their addiction to television and video games. He presents down-to-earth recommendations for solving these common family problems-problems that too often erode the joyfulness of our children and our pleasure in being parents.<br><br><em>Pride and Joy</em> is both informative and highly practical, and a balanced answer to the extreme methods that too often dominate parenting debates.

Wachtel, Ph.D., author of <em>Treating Troubled Children and Their Families</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Stepping into the national debate over whether parents are too soft, or too worried, or too distracted to raise strong kids, Dr. Barish shares his insights into the emotional lives of children and what kids need from parents to develop resilience, optimism, the capacity for hard work, and the other good things we want for them. Dr. Barish understands that parenting can be child-centered without indulging or catering to children. By acknowledging kids' feelings, we can more effectively help them develop self-discipline. He offers an excellent guide to building the kind of warm, positive relationship with kids that is the key to setting, and enforcing, the limits that they need."-- Harold S. Koplewicz, M.D., President, Child Mind Institute <br> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Pride and Joy</em> is a book overflowing with the unmistakable signs of wisdom that only decades of experience can produce. Ken Barish has written the book that every clinician dreams about being able to write and every parent (and grandparent!) dreams about being there to read.

The book is addressed to students, but is just as valuable for instructors since learning and teaching are two sides of a coin. <p> There is no book in existence today that addresses so comprehensively, authoritatively, and authentically the issues students face in college mathematics. The ideas in this study and reference book, grounded in research and experience, could keep students from receiving an undesirable grade, dropping a course, changing an area of concentration, or dropping out of college. This book will help students realize fully the mathematics potential that lies within them. It can generally be described as a book on learning how to learn.</p><p> There are many gems of wisdom for the struggling to the strong mathematics student, including mathematics concentrators. Success in mathematics is described as more than receiving a good course grade. Students learn what their deficiencies are and how to overcome them. </p><p> Students find out how to: improve as problem solvers, manage assignments, determine if they have course prerequisites, write mathematics, work with symbolic form, read their textbooks, get the most out of class, make the most of their learning styles, learn online, work with classmates, select and work with instructors, determine whether to drop a course, retake a course, decrease procrastination and anxiety, increase confidence and motivation, prepare for and take examinations, and manage their responsibilities. </p><p> The primary organization of the book is this: A key topic is presented in a thorough way, and referenced again when related topics are presented. This spiraling reinforces knowledge of the topic. There is an extensive table of contents and index; thus, it is easy to find what is needed at the time. Chapters stand alone; hence, students can begin to read at virtually any place in the book, and move back and forth to chapters or sections of interest to them. </p><p> Support for the relevance of the learning and study issues discussed includes: remarks from successful college mathematics students on what worked for them in their college mathematics courses, and from unsuccessful college mathematics students on what did not work for them; statements by college mathematics students which came from their free responses to questions on forms used to evaluate their instructors and courses; suggestions from experienced college mathematics instructors on issues they believe need to be addressed; findings of educational research; position papers of the American Mathematical Association and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; and the formal academic training, scholarship, and extensive college teaching experience of the author in mathematics and mathematics education. </p><p> An Assignment Manual, comprised of exercises on the content of the Second Edition, is available. The book and manual are purchased separately since some students and instructors may only want to use the book as a reference; hence, having the option of purchasing the assignment manual. Exercises are most valuable when feedback is provided through participation in a course, seminar, workshop, or any other discussion group. </p><p> This resource is valuable for (1) college mathematics students, (2) college-prep high students, (3) college and high school mathematics instructors (preservice and inservice), and (4) college and high school counselors and other academic support personnel.</p></p><p>Professor Richard M. Dahlke has an extensive formal academic background in mathematics and mathematics education. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point, with a Bachelor of Science Degree in mathematics, and a teaching certificate in secondary school mathematics. He holds a Master of Arts degree in teaching mathematics from California State University, San Diego, and a Master of Science degree in mathematics and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in mathematics education from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He taught high school mathematics in Wisconsin for three years and college mathematics for the next thirty-six years. His first two years of college teaching were at the State University of New York, College at Buffalo. <p> As a college professor of mathematics for thirty-four years at the University of Michigan, Dearborn, he taught all the courses in the calculus track lower-division mathematics program to students pursuing degrees in mathematics, engineering, natural sciences and business. At the upper-division level he taught linear algebra, abstract algebra, geometry from an advanced viewpoint, and specialized courses for students pursuing a major or minor in elementary school mathematics. He taught courses in problem solving in mathematics, and techniques of teaching secondary school mathematics. </p><p> His professional accomplishments are many. He has been an active conference presenter and workshop leader at local, state, and national conferences. He served two terms as chair of the Michigan Council of Teachers of Mathematics (MCTM) Teacher Preparation Committee, and served for many years as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics representative to MCTM and the Detroit Area Council of Teachers of Mathematics. His writings and research have focused on issues associated with the learning and teaching of mathematics at all levels of education. He has published widely in academic journals on a variety of mathematics and mathematics education subjects. </p><p> Professor Dahlke is a strong advocate for college students, including their right to receive quality mathematics instruction. He believes that learning is a partnership among the student, the student s classmates, and the instructor, and that students efforts to organize and manage their time is critical to success in college. He further believes that students should enjoy college. In order for that to happen students shouldn t get stressed out or too alarmed when things do not go well. They need to focus their energies on making necessary changes that will improve their college experience and lessen stress and anxiety. The end result will be successful college students with contented spirits.</p>At first glance I was skeptical of the length of this book (and the duplication in the subtitle); but it is chock full of clear exposition of excellent advice, with careful sectioning and bolding of important points, and it would be hard to point to anything to omit. Much of the advice applies to college in general, but much is specific to mathematics, including how courses are sequenced, how to get credit by examination, and how to obtain assistance. Author Dahlke explains the benefits of learning mathematics and what it means to think mathematically, as well as how to read, write, discuss, listen to, and work problems in mathematics. Rationales accompany the advice and this renders it more credible. Dahlke makes it clear how and why college differs from high school.

What they need is in [this] excellent book. It gives students a comparative perspective on what is exceptional in the American democratic design, what leads democracies to differ from and resemble one another, and how these differences and similarities affect students&#x2032; lives. I strongly recommend the authors&#x2019; approach and their book." -- Marjorie R. Hershey<br><br>"This book follows the Tocquevillian logic that the best way to understand American politics is to compare to other nations. American Difference offers a very readable and engaging introduction to what is distinct about American political institutions, culture, interest groups, and party politics&#x2015;and the implications of these differences. A strong addition to any American politics course." -- Russell Dalton</p><h2>Learning the UNIX Operating System, Fifth Edition</h2><p><p>If you are new to Unix, this concise book will tell you just what you need to get started and no more. Unix was one of the first operating systems written in C, a high-level programming language, and its natural portability and low price made it a popular choice among universities. Initially, two main dialects of Unix existed: one produced by AT&amp;T known as System V, and one developed at UC Berkeley and known as BSD. In recent years, many other dialects have been created, including the highly popular Linux operating system and the new Mac OS X (a derivative of BSD).<i>Learning the Unix Operating System</i> is a handy book for someone just starting with Unix or Linux, and it's an ideal primer for Mac and PC users of the Internet who need to know a little about Unix on the systems they visit. The fifth edition is the most effective introduction to Unix in print, covering Internet usage for email, file transfers, web browsing, and many major and minor updates to help the reader navigate the ever-expanding capabilities of the operating system:</p><ul><li>In response to the popularity of Linux, the book now focuses on the popular bash shell preferred by most Linux users.</li><li>Since the release of the fourth edition, the Internet and its many functions has become part of most computer user's lives. A new chapter explains how to use ftp, pine for mail, and offers useful knowledge on how to surf the web.</li><li>Today everyone is concerned about security. With this in mind, the author has included tips throughout the text on security basics, especially in the Internet and networking sections.</li></ul>The book includes a completely updated quick reference card to make it easier for the reader to access the key functions of the command line.</p><p>Part basic primer, part reference guide, this slim volume will make your life with UNIX much simpler. This book is specifically designed for those who are new to UNIX and contains neither introductory-level condescension nor advanced-level gibberish. Well-indexed and clearly mapped, <i>Learning the UNIX Operating System</i> will show you how to use and manage files and get your e-mail as well as how to perform more advanced tasks, such as redirecting standard input/output and multitasking your processes. Those new to the UNIX world will appreciate its concise presentation, and those reasonably familiar with UNIX will learn many new shortcuts, tricks, and tools. <i>--Jennifer Buckendorff</i>If you are new to UNIX, this concise introduction will tell you just what you need to get started and no more. Why wade through a 600-page book when you can begin working productively in a matter of minutes? Topics covered include: Logging in and logging out Window systems (especially X/Motif) Managing UNIX files and directories Sending and receiving mail Redirecting input/output Pipes and filters Background processing Basic network commands This book is the most effective introduction to UNIX in print. The third edition provides increased coverage of window systems and networking. It&#39;s a handy book for someone just starting with UNIX, as well as someone who encounters a UNIX system as a &#34;visitor&#34; via remote login over the Internet.</p><h2>Chemistry: A Molecular Approach -- Modified Mastering Chemistry with Pearson eText Access Code</h2><p><p> <i>This product features all of the resources of Modified Mastering Chemistry in addition to the Pearson eText.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Mastering&#x2122; is the teaching and learning platform that empowers you to reach <i>every</i> student.

Overton asked family members from diverse income levels and racial and ethnic groups, whose children varied in age and learning challenge, to record their personal stories. Many of these family members were not well-known or active in their children's schools; their cases facilitate an understanding and respect for the variety of families in which children live. The resulting set of cases will stimulate reflection, provoke discussion, and encourage the determination of best practices to support and bring about collaboration with all families.<p> Activities, margin notes, and author commentaries emphasize and clarify points, facilitate reflection, and tie theory and research to each story. This compelling book can make a difference for those who work with students with special needs and their family members.</p></p><p><p> The idea for this book must have germinated for years before it suddenly popped up in a moment of insight. As a teacher-educator and parent, I always tried to share my respect for families with the students in my classes. I told stories about the many families I knew and invited numerous parents to speak to my classes. Although students were typically inspired and gained valuable insights, they were not fully aware of the wide range of parents they would meet in their classrooms. I wanted to facilitate my students' understanding and respect for the variety of families with which they would work. </p> <p> I began to ask family members to write their stories for me. I sought to obtain a good mixture of people from across the country, from different income levels and personal histories, from diverse racial and ethnic groups, who had children with various disabilities at various ages. I drew on a number of individuals I met from living and working in various parts of the country. In addition, I contacted other individuals around the country to ask if they were aware of individuals who would be willing to share their stories. These contacts included teachers and administrators, parent e-mail groups, parent centers, and others whom I knew had some interaction with individuals with disabilities. I particularly wanted to include individuals whom others would not consider active in their children's schools or disability organizations, and I looked for fathers and others whom educators may not know as well. The family members wrote or dictated their stories with minimal direction from me. As time passed, I asked for elaboration or clarification of their stories. While I provided some editing or rearranging to make the cases more useable, I was committed to making minimal changes to preserve the tone of each storyteller's voice. I felt that it was important that the individuals be heard and respected just as they were in reality, rather than polished versions. To check the suitability of the story resulting from my editing, family members read and approved my versions. All names were changed to preserve confidentiality. </p> <p> The activities, margin notes, and commentaries developed over time to emphasize and clarify points, facilitate reflection, tie theory and research to the story, and occasionally to correct the misinformation presented by parents. Even though parents do not always operate with the most accurate or current information, the publisher and I were committed to publishing accurate information for teacher preparation. All of the cases have been field tested and reviewed multiple times, allowing revision to enhance their use. The result is a set of diverse cases that have been successful in stimulating reflection and discussion and, I hope, more reflective practice. It is my hope that, at the end of your work with this book, you will have developed many resources and ideas for working with families. To that end, each case asks you to determine and discuss the best practices that would support and facilitate collaboration with each family. </p>&#34;This brief book of thought-provoking case studies helps students put themselves in the place of families who face a variety of challenges. I used this text in a graduate course designed for general education teachers and special education teachers. The students loved it. Just a single case could prompt the class to talk for an hour or more. Student reactions ranged from laughter to tears.&#34; --Joan E.

With its vast supplies of conventional resources and nonconventional stores, the extension of long-distance gas pipelines and the recent expansion of liquefied natural gas trade, a truly global market has been created for this clean fuel.</p> <p><i>Natural Gas: Fuel for the 21st Century</i> discusses the place and prospects of natural gas in modern high-energy societies. Vaclav Smil presents a systematic survey of the qualities, origins, extraction, processing and transportation of natural gas, followed by a detailed appraisal of its many preferred, traditional and potential uses, and the recent emergence of the fuel as a globally traded commodity. The unfolding diversification of sources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, and the role of natural gas in national and global energy transitions are described. The book concludes with a discussion on the advantages, risks, benefits and costs of natural gas as a leading, if not dominant, fuel of the 21st century.</p> <p>This interdisciplinary text will be of interest to a wide readership concerned with global energy affairs including professionals and academics in energy and environmental science, policy makers, consultants and advisors with an interest in the rapidly-changing global energy industry.</p></p><p><p><strong>Vaclav Smil</strong> is Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg Canada.

Nothing. Still too dark to make out anything beyond the tree line. He sighed, letting the binoculars dangle down his chest. Behind him on the porch, a little brown-and-white dog perched on a padded bar stool. The dog watched the sheriff intently, as if sensing some danger.<br> <br>Tully glanced at the dog. &#x201c;Still too dark to see anything, Clarence. You don&#x2019;t have to worry, anyway. It&#x2019;s me he&#x2019;s after, not you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clarence laid his chin down on his paws.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Tully said to him. &#x201c;<i>Now</i> you relax!&#x201d;<br> <br>The sun began to rise over the ridge to the east. Soon its rays penetrated the tree line on the west ridge. Tully, wearing khakis, a red-and-blue tattersall shirt, a well-aged leather jacket, and his three-thousand-dollar alligator-skin cowboy boots, raised the binoculars and again scanned the woods. A deer stood there, gazing down at the meadow. A good sign. Tully could detect no movement among the trees. He turned at the sound of a motor. A pickup truck was coming down the road that wound across the meadow to his house. Deputy Brian Pugh pulled up and got out of the truck. He was wearing jeans, a sweatshirt, and a baseball cap. He was ridiculously trim and fit. His squinty eyes gave his face a hard look, softened a bit by the brown mustache that adorned his upper lip. A sheriff&#x2019;s department badge was fastened to a pocket of his faded jeans.<br> <br>&#x201c;Morning, Bo.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Morning, Pugh.&#x201d;<br> <br>The dog raised his head off his paws and growled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut up, Clarence,&#x201d; Pugh said as he came up the porch steps. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like criminals growling at me.&#x201d; He was referring to the little dog&#x2019;s several arrests for hiding under cars and biting people on the ankles, usually a little old lady with an armload of packages. Clarence stopped growling.<br> <br>Tully said, &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t like a nice little dog, would you, Pugh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No way. You were supposed to take Clarence out in the woods and knock him off. It&#x2019;s not my fault you&#x2019;re turning soft.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let it get around. Anyway, I&#x2019;ve got a place all fixed up for you by the window in the studio upstairs. The rifle is sighted in at three hundred yards. That should give you a dead-on shot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How can I be sure it&#x2019;s Kincaid?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a major spotting scope up there. At three hundred yards, you should be able to pick out the sex of a mosquito on his face. I suspect he may be wearing that stupid cap of his, the red-and-black-plaid one with the earflaps tied up on top. Besides, he&#x2019;ll have a rifle with him. Shouldn&#x2019;t be anybody up there with a rifle in June.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You want me to kill him, right?&#x201d; Pugh said.<br> <br>Tully gave him his crooked smile, a look known to the members of his department as The Look.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gotcha.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tully got up and opened the door for Pugh. &#x201c;As you know, I&#x2019;ve got company coming today&#x2014;lots of it. So don&#x2019;t be poking the rifle barrel out the window. No point in making folks nervous. I fixed you up a comfortable chair and a good rest for the rifle. I guess you know your way up to the studio.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;One other thing, Pugh.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t miss.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pugh went inside just as a large flatbed truck came lumbering down the road. The bed of the truck was piled high with green picnic tables and benches. They had been collected from the city park by two of the sheriff&#x2019;s deputies. The truck stopped three-quarters of the way down the road. Men got out and began unloading the tables and benches and arranging them about the meadow. They had done all this before. Shortly thereafter, pickup trucks began arriving with coolers stacked in the beds, the wild-game contents of his deputies&#x2019; freezers. This was the fourth annual Sheriff Bo Tully Empty the Freezer Day, one of the greatest political ploys ever committed in the entire history of Blight County, perhaps even in the history of Idaho or even of the United States. Tully couldn&#x2019;t help but smile.<br> <br>A couple hours later, cars began turning off the highway and parking in the upper part of the meadow. The occupants got out and came down the road carrying shovels and axes. They began digging holes in the sod of the meadow and lining the holes with rocks. Some of the men carried firewood and piled it next to the holes. Soon a dozen fires were burning in the meadow, an area Tully usually referred to as his yard. Iron racks were set up next to some of the fires, while others were fitted out with grills.<br> <br>By noon, slabs of deer and elk ribs were roasting on the iron racks. Grills simmered with smoked elk sausages, elk and venison steaks, and various kinds of ground meat patties&#x2014;deer, elk, bear, moose, antelope, sheep, porcupine, and enough mystery meats to cover most of the other wild animal species of Idaho. Tully had once tried what turned out to be a weasel patty and from then on had taken care to avoid all mystery meats.<br> <br>One large bed of coals contained foil-wrapped packages of sliced potatoes and onions. Huge skillets of grouse gravy bubbled on two charcoal grills. Smoked kokanee salmon protruded in pink and golden patinas out of greasy boxes. Tables were laden with double rows of salads&#x2014;potato, pasta, Jell-O, carrot-raisin, coleslaw, ambrosia, layered, sauerkraut, four-bean, and fruit. All of the salads had been provided by residents of Blight County, along with enough pies to cover the tops of several tables. Assorted local bands took turns furnishing the musical background.<br> <br>By one o&#x2019;clock Sheriff Bo Tully&#x2019;s Freezer Day was in full gluttonous uproar. Local politicians and their spouses filled two tables that had been pushed together. They glanced enviously around at the partying crowd. Why hadn&#x2019;t one of them thought of this scam?<br> <br>Tully smiled. Absently scratching an itch through his shirt, he made a rough calculation of the number of votes represented in his yard and meadow, more than enough, he calculated, to guarantee his winning the next election hands-down, in the unlikely event he even had an opponent. The citizens of Blight County loved him, particularly the women. His close scrutiny of the crowd, however, had little to do with votes. His interest lay in one Lucas Kincaid, a nasty piece of work if ever there was one.<br> <br>After serving only two months of a life sentence for murder and the cultivation and sale of marijuana, Kincaid had somehow escaped from a prison van hauling him to a hospital for a mental evaluation that Tully himself could have provided&#x2014;crazy! Kincaid had left the two guards accompanying him dead, not because of any necessity related to his escape but, Tully mused, probably as an afterthought. The homicidal maniac had soon let it be known about the county that his first order of business was to kill the man who had put him in prison, one Sheriff Bo Tully. Some people are such sore losers.<br> <br>Tully&#x2019;s eyes fixed on a figure advancing toward him through the crowd. It was a very nice figure. The pretty blond woman wore a white dress distinguished mostly for its brevity, one of Tully&#x2019;s favorite elements of female fashion. Coming up to the porch, she held out her hand. Tully leaped to his feet, grasped the hand, and gave it a little squeeze.<br> <br>The young woman laughed. &#x201c;You are even more handsome than my aunt let on,&#x201d; she said, her blue eyes twinkling.<br> <br>&#x201c;How is that possible?&#x201d; Tully said. &#x201c;And exactly who is this extraordinarily perceptive aunt? More to the point, who are you, sweetheart?&#x201d;<br> <br>She tried to pull back her hand but Tully refused to let it go. In such cases, he didn&#x2019;t believe in catch-and-release.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bunny Hunter,&#x201d; she said, laughing. &#x201c;My aunt is Agatha Wrenn. Actually, she is my great-aunt.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tully dropped her hand. &#x201c;Agatha! Agatha sent her young and beautiful niece to see me? She must be in the grip of Alzheimer&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; Bunny said, smiling as she unstuck a wisp of blond hair from her perspiring face. &#x201c;Her mind is very sharp, even the more so for someone up in her eighties. In fact before sending me on this mission, she warned me extensively about you. So I am well prepared to fend off your charms, should you attempt to display any.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And here I thought I already had,&#x201d; Tully said. &#x201c;My supply of charms must be running low today. So what can I do for you, Miss Hunter? Or, rather, for your Aunt Agatha? She and her friend Bernice, by the way, just happen to be two of my most favorite people in the entire world.&#x201d; He sat down on a porch step and motioned for Bunny to sit down beside him. &#x201c;Please have a step, Miss Hunter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; she said, sitting down and demurely smoothing her dress, which reached almost halfway to her dimpled knees.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now tell me,&#x201d; Tully said, &#x201c;exactly what is the mission Aunt Agatha has sent you on?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m to persuade you to solve a mystery for her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My specialty!&#x201d;<br> <br>Bunny laughed. &#x201c;This one is really weird, though. I&#x2019;m embarrassed even to bring it up but I promised I would. She wants you to find out if her father&#x2014;my great-grandfather&#x2014;was murdered and, if so, by whom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I see. And what makes Agatha think her father may have been murdered?&#x201d;<br> <br>At that moment a pixyish little man strode by, his hat pulled down onto his ears, his hands thrust deep into his pockets.<br> <br>&#x201c;Petey!&#x201d; Tully roared.<br> <br>The little man jumped and spun around. &#x201c;Bo! You scared me half to death!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought I had you in jail, Petey!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You did, Bo! I got sprung yesterday!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh? Well, in that case, have a good time. Stop by the pie table. My mom&#x2019;s ramrodding it. Tell her I said to give you something special.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell her you said so, Bo.&#x201d; Petey went on his way.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry about that,&#x201d; he said to Bunny, who wore a startled expression. &#x201c;I have a hard time keeping track of my criminals.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can see that.&#x201d; She went on to answer his question. &#x201c;Agatha&#x2019;s father disappeared one day back in 1927. His helper, Sean O&#x2019;Boyle, a boy of about fourteen, disappeared with him. One day they went off to work a small gold mine they had hidden away in the Snowy Mountains and were never seen nor heard from again. Agatha claims her mother told her that her father wasn&#x2019;t the kind of man to run off like that. All these years, Agatha has wondered what happened to the two of them. She believes they must have been murdered or maybe killed in a mine cave-in. Agatha says you can figure out if they were murdered and, if so, who did it. She thinks you&#x2019;re a genius.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really? Well, she has always been extraordinarily perceptive. I became aware of it when I was one of her students at the U. of I. Oddly, I don&#x2019;t recall she thought I was a genius back in those days.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She does now. Anyway, may I tell Aunt Agatha you will look into the mystery? I realize there&#x2019;s no chance you could solve a crime that old, even if there was one, but maybe you could at least pretend to, for Agatha&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Pretend! You&#x2019;ve got to be kidding, Miss Hunter. Of course I&#x2019;ll come up and solve the mystery. As it happens I&#x2019;ve been thinking of taking a vacation and getting out of town for a while. Solving this little puzzle sounds like just the kind of vacation I most enjoy. Are you by any chance hanging out at the ranch?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bunny laughed. &#x201c;Why, yes I am. I&#x2019;m staying there for the summer to work on the dissertation for my doctorate in American studies at Washington State University.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wonderful!&#x201d; Tully said. &#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t have a better mentor around than Agatha.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s for sure. Well, I hope you&#x2019;ll stop by the ranch soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can count on it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bunny gave Tully a blazing smile, stood up, and dusted off the seat of her tiny dress, a gesture that caused Tully&#x2019;s heart to skip two beats. She disappeared into the crowd of picnickers.<br> <br>Yes, Tully thought, he would definitely make a point of driving up to Quail Creek Ranch. Might even work up a scheme to kill two birds with one stone. Well, maybe three birds, counting Bunny.<br> <br>A trim, elderly man with close-cropped white hair walked out onto the porch. He carried a steaming plate of shrimp. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the babe?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;None of your business,&#x201d; Tully said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re much too old to be eyeing a woman like that. Could bring on a heart attack.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did feel a twinge when she brushed off her seat,&#x201d; Pap Tully said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not a bad way to go, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tully smiled at his father. &#x201c;Never ends, does it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope, it don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So where did the shrimp come from? They smell wonderful!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Anything does, cooked in butter and garlic. There&#x2019;s a guy in your kitchen cooking up huge piles of them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really? I better pay this mystery chef a visit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He seems to have about a ton of shrimp. Said his seafood truck broke down outside of Blight, so he figured he might as well bring the shrimp over for your Freezer Day. Saw one of your posters on a utility pole. Man, I wish I&#x2019;d have had enough sense to come up with this scam when I was sheriff.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tully chuckled. &#x201c;I reckon this was the only scam you missed.&#x201d; He walked into the house and picked up a plate from a stack on his living-room table. A man in Tully&#x2019;s &#x201c;Wild in the Kitchen&#x201d; camouflage apron was at his range, scooping heaps of shrimp onto the plate of a plump young woman. &#x201c;They smell divine!&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Tully stepped up and held out his plate. &#x201c;Nice apron.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks. I found it in that closet over there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where did you come from anyway?&#x201d;<br> <br>The mystery chef looked up from his skillet. His gray hair was longish but trimmed in an expensive cut. Wire-rimmed glasses sat low on his nose, which glistened with sweat. &#x201c;And you are?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the guy who owns the kitchen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, the famous Bo Tully, sheriff and artist. I&#x2019;m Sid Brown, owner of the Giggling Loon Restaurant in Boise.&#x201d; He held out his hand. Tully shook it. &#x201c;You have a very nice kitchen here, Sheriff. And please don&#x2019;t view my intrusion as an intrusion.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all, Sid. In fact, your shrimp appear to be the highlight of my Freezer Day. I hope your truck breaks down every time you haul shrimp through Blight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually, I had another truck come up from Boise to haul out the halibut and salmon. I decided to hold back the shrimp, though, after I saw a poster about your Freezer Day. I&#x2019;ve been a big fan of your painting for years.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, indeed. I have four of your watercolors hanging in my restaurant and two more on the walls at home.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Six of my watercolors! You&#x2019;re obviously rich.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am rich, but I got your watercolors back when they were still cheap.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tully smiled and sampled a shrimp. &#x201c;They sold a lot better when they were cheap. Sid, these shrimp are delicious. You can come to my Freezer Day anytime.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a terrific artist, Bo. I bought all the paintings from Jean Runyan&#x2019;s gallery in Spokane. Jean&#x2019;s been talking you up for years. Wants to put on a one-man show for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pretty small gallery, but I would love a show.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She says she would try to put it in the mezzanine of the Davenport Hotel.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow, the Davenport. That&#x2019;s pretty classy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You bet it&#x2019;s classy. And she wants the loan of my paintings along with whatever you have or can collect.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tully held out his plate for shrimp. Sid heaped it full. Tully picked up one and ate it. He smacked his lips. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re definitely an artist with shrimp, Sid.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I love any kind of a...</p><h2>Agent 6 (The Child 44 Trilogy, 3)</h2><p>THREE DECADES.<br>TWO MURDERS.<br>ONE CONSPIRACY.<br><br><em>WHO IS AGENT 6?<br></em><br>Tom Rob Smith's debut, Child 44, was an immediate publishing sensation and marked the arrival of a major new talent in contemporary fiction.

His critically acclaimed books, high-profile media interviews, and year-round speaking schedule have established him as an invaluable voice in any discussion on issues of race and multicultural democracy.</p><p><b>In <i>Under the Affluence</i>, Wise discusses a related issue: economic inequality and the demonization of those in need. He reminds us that there was a time when the hardship of fellow Americans stirred feelings of sympathy, solidarity for struggling families, and support for policies and programs meant to alleviate poverty.</b> Today, however, mainstream discourse blames people with low income for their own situation, and the notion of an intractable "culture of poverty" has pushed our country in an especially ugly direction.</p><p>Tim Wise argues that far from any culture of poverty, it is the culture of predatory affluence that deserves the blame for America's simmering economic and social crises. He documents the increasing contempt for the nation's poor, and reveals the forces at work to create and perpetuate it. With clarity, passion and eloquence, he demonstrates how America's myth of personal entitlement based on merit is inextricably linked to pernicious racial bigotry, and he points the way to greater compassion, fairness, and economic justice.</p><p><b>Tim Wise</b> is the author of many books, including <i>Dear White America</i> and <i>Colorblind</i>.<br></p><p>"Tim Wise is one of the great public moralists in America today. In his bracing new book, <i>Under the Affluence</i>, he brilliantly engages the roots and ramifications of radical inequality in our nation, carefully detailing the heartless war against the poor and the swooning addiction to the rich that exposes the moral sickness at the heart of our culture. Wise's stirring analysis of our predicament is more than a disinterested social scientific treatise; this book is a valiant call to arms against the vicious practices that undermine the best of the American ideals we claim to cherish. <i>Under the Affluence</i> is vintage Tim Wise: smart, sophisticated, conscientious, and righteously indignant at the betrayal of millions of citizens upon whose backs the American Dream rests.

James Loewen, author of <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i> and <i>Sundown Towns</i>.</p><p>"Acclaimed inequality essayist and community activist Wise (<i>Dear White America: Letter to a New Minority</i>, 2012, etc.) reports on the damage being incurred in America whereby 'the have-nots and have-lessers are dehumanized while the elite are venerated.' In describing how modern society has become a 'culture of cruelty,' as past attempts to sympathize and support those less fortunate have collapsed beneath the weight of classism and racism, the author explores the framework and the consequences of the nation&#x2019;s economic crisis. He lucidly ponders its genesis as well as the ramifications of wealth inequality, including the rampant demonization of the poor and the valorization of the rich by way of what he refers to as 'Scroogism.' Wise&#x2019;s extensive experience as an anti-racism activist and a longtime member of the radical left greatly informs his text, which demonstrates, through facts and case histories, that America's enduring racial divide continues to be directly tied to its economic problems. His well-rounded scholarly discussion benefits from the varying intellectual perspectives he offers, including opinions on the damaging effects of blind corporate obeisance to the 'myth of meritocracy.' What is apparent, he believes, is the need for solutions to achieve the kind of 'culture of compassion' necessary for true redemption and a dismantling of social stratification. Wise recognizes that this achievement is a tall order to fill, particularly in the presence of the current elite economic oligarchy possessing the capital and the influence to trounce equalization efforts. Sharp and provocative the book concludes with hope that his analysis and those like it will spur a counter-narrative outwardly challenging the false notion that both the wealthy and the poor 'deserve' their places within our culture&#x2019;s economic stratum.

Overall, the book is an impassioned and heartfelt defense of the poor that is rooted in the idea that America can, as Wise says, 'crawl from under the affluence to a place more equitable.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;Eleanor J.

She has lived her life eye to eye with the Grim Reaper, and she writes vividly about it in this book, which is part primer on the basics of identifying human remains, part frank memoir of a woman whose first paying job as a schoolgirl was to apprentice in a butcher shop, and part no-nonsense but deeply humane introduction to the reality of death in our lives. It is a treat for CSI junkies, murder mystery and thriller readers, and anyone seeking a clear-eyed guide to a subject that touches us all.<br><br>Cutting through hype, romanticism, and clich�, she recounts her first dissection; her own first acquaintance with a loved one&#x2019;s death; the mortal remains in her lab and at burial sites as well as scenes of violence, murder, and criminal dismemberment; and about investigating mass fatalities due to war, accident, or natural disaster, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

That was the great battle for Butte, Montana, at the dawn of the 20th century when it was the richest hill on earth. Copper was the treasure, eagerly sought for wiring the modern world, and the hard rock below Butte was riddled with thick veins of the precious metal. Those who controlled the copper could make billions of dollars, the fortune sought by three men who fought for Butte&#x2019;s mineral wealth with greed and generosity, cruelty and compassion, cowardice and courage.<br>In this astonishing battle, they used their fabulous wealth to buy courts, newspapers, politicians, banks, police, and anything and anyone that could help them and hinder their opponents. To get what they wanted, their money flowed like snowmelt through the mile-high city and eventually reached the nation&#x2019;s capital. All the while the miners toiled thousands of feet below ground in tunnels dug with blasting powder, picks, and shovels. And sometimes, backed by rival copper kings, they also battled, with fists and dynamite, either on the streets of Butte or far below the surface.<br>At this time, Butte was the largest city between Minneapolis and Portland, and it was a wide-open town, born only recently in the rugged Rocky Mountains. Illustrated by rare historical photos, this book tells the story of Butte and the copper kings, a story of raw human drama and timeless historical significance.</p><p></p><h2>She</h2><p>Hailed as "a dreadlocked dervish of words...the Bob Marley of American poets" <i>(Esquire),</i> Saul Williams is a gifted young poet who is opening up this literary art form to a new generation of readers.

Recognizing that AA may not work for everyone, they present a form of cognitive therapy known as Rational Emotive Therapy (RET). In RET, the alcoholic's irrational beliefs about drinking are consistently flushed out, challenged, and replaced with more rational ones. The authors also address "stinking thinking," a phrase coined by AA to describe the negative thoughts that often lead to relapse. Exercises in positive self-talk, creative imagery, and daily self-care are included. The ideas presented are similar to those found in a growing number of titles that offer alternatives to AA, including Jack Trimpey's The Small Book: Revolutionary Alternatives for Overcoming Alcohol and Drug Dependence (Delacorte, 1991). However, the information may be more beneficial when coupled with professional guidance. Purchase for self-help, psychology, and medical collections.<br><i>- Linda S.

Brandon Schechter attends to a diverse array of things&#x2015;from spoons to tanks&#x2015;to show how a wide array of citizens became soldiers, and how the provisioning of material goods separated soldiers from civilians.</p><p>Through a fascinating examination of leaflets, proclamations, newspapers, manuals, letters to and from the front, diaries, and interviews, <i>The Stuff of Soldiers</i> reveals how the use of everyday items made it possible to wage war.

These objects narrate the experience of people at war, illuminating the changes taking place in Soviet society over the course of the most destructive conflict in recorded history. Schechter argues that spoons, shovels, belts, and watches held as much meaning to the waging of war as guns and tanks.<i> In The Stuff of Soldiers</i>, he describes the transformative potential of material things to create a modern culture, citizen, and soldier during World War II.</p></p><p><p>Brandon Schechter is the Elihu Rose Scholar in Modern Military History at New York University.

Hays-- Duke Divinity School&#34;This richly synthetic reading of Paul offers a compelling argument that the heart of Paul&#39;s soteriology lies in theosis -- the incorporation of God&#39;s people into the life and character of the God revealed in the cross. Michael Gorman deftly integrates the results of recent debates about Pauline theology into a powerful constructive account that overcomes unfruitful dichotomies and transcends recent controversies between the &#39;New Perspective on Paul&#39; and its traditionalist critics. Gorman&#39;s important book points the way forward for understanding the nonviolent, world-transforming character of Paul&#39;s gospel.&#34;Stephen Finlan-- Fordham University&#34;Provides an important corrective to segmentalized approaches to Paul. Michael Gorman lucidly connects justification to spiritual transformation. Faith, love, and action come together as theosis -- the taking on of the character of Christ and, so, of God. Though constantly in conversation with other scholars, Gorman has a refreshingly original approach, illuminating the lively theology of Paul. &#34;Inhabiting the Cruciform God&#34; clearly advances the field of Pauline studies.&#34;Frank J. Matera-- Catholic University of America&#34;In this pioneering work Michael Gorman offers a fresh way to view Paul&#39;s understanding of justification and holiness. Cutting a new path through old territory, Gorman leads us to a vision of holiness and justification rooted in the transforming power of nonviolence and the cross.

No explanations. No second chances. She was gone and wasn't coming back. Shocked and heartbroken, Colin fell into a spiral of depression and loneliness. <br>Soon after, a friend told Colin about a dog in need of rescue--a neglected 140-pound Newfoundland Landseer, a breed renowned for its friendly nature and remarkable swimming abilities. Colin adopted the traumatized dog, brought him home and named him George. Both man and dog were heartbroken and lacking trust, but together, they learned how to share a space, how to socialize, and most of all, how to overcome their bad experiences. At the same time, Colin relived childhood memories of his beloved grandfather, a decorated war hero and a man who gave him hope when he needed it most.<br><br>Then everything changed. Colin was offered a great new job in Los Angeles, California. He took George with him and the pair began a new life together on the sunny beaches around L.A. George became a fixture in his Hermosa Beach neighborhood, attracting attention and giving affection to everyone he met, warming hearts both young and old. Meanwhile, Colin headed to the beach to rekindle his love for surfing, but when George encountered the ocean and a surfboard for the first time, he did a surprising thing--he jumped right on the board. Through surfing, George and Colin began a life-altering adventure and a deep healing process that brought them back to life. As their story took them to exciting new heights, Colin learned how to follow George's lead, discovering that he may have rescued George but that in the end, it was George who rescued him. <br><i>Free Days with George</i> is an uplifting, inspirational story about the healing power of animals, and about leaving the past behind to embrace love, hope and happiness.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><p>COLIN CAMPBELL has worked as a marketing executive in both the United States and Canada for the past twenty-four years.

Their object is rather to lay, if that be possible, an explanation of it before the English reader; so that he may understand both what it was and how it proceeded, and also why certain problems hitherto unfamiliar to Englishmen have risen out of it.&#x201d; &#x201c;If a personal point may be noted, the fact that the writer of these pages is himself a Catholic and in political sympathy strongly attached to the political theory of the Revolution, should not be hidden from the reader. Such personal conditions have perhaps enabled him to treat the matter more thoroughly than it might have been treated by one who rejected either Republicanism upon the one hand, or Catholicism upon the other; but he believes that no personal and therefore exaggerated note has been allowed to intrude upon his description of what is a definite piece of objective history lying in the field of record rather than in that of opinion.&#x201d; &#x2014;Hilaire Belloc</p><p></p><h2>How to Become a Witch: The Path of Nature, Spirit &amp; Magick</h2><p><p>Set forth on the Witch's path&#x2015;this friendly introductory guide presents the key beliefs and practices of Witchcraft and offers step-by-step instruction on how to become a Witch.

She reveals the multiple strategies they use to navigate interpersonal and gender-specific violence and how they reconcile the gendered dilemmas of their adolescence.

(Joanne Belknap <i>author of The Invisible Woman: Gender, Crime &amp; Justice</i>)<br><br>"<i>Between Good and Ghetto</i> is an expertly written and fascinating ethnography of the gendered racial dimensions of violence in the inner city.

(Howard S. Becker <i>author of Outsiders and Writing for Social Scientists</i>)<br><br>"The young women in<i> Between Good and Ghetto</i> compel the reader to consider their lives and the violence they experience in relation to the shifting and dynamic concept of protection.

He divides his time between Florida and New Hampshire.<b>Prologue</b><p>October&nbsp;15, 2007<br>Monday, 7:00 P.M.<br>DELHI, INDIA</p><p>Only those long-term residents of Delhi who were extraordinarily sensitive to the vicissitudes of the city's traffic patterns could tell that rush hour had peaked and was now on the downward slope. The cacophony of horns, sirens, and screeches seemed undiminished to the tortured, untrained ear. The crush appeared unabated. There were gaudily painted trucks; buses with as many riders clinging precariously to the outside and on the roof as were inside; autos, ranging from hulking Mercedes to diminutive Marutis; throngs of black-and-yellow taxis; auto rickshaws; various motorcycles and scooters, many carrying entire families; and swarms of black, aged bicycles. Thousands of pedestrians wove in and out of the stop-and-go traffic, while hordes of dirty children dressed in rags thrust soiled hands into open windows in search of a few coins. Cows, dogs, and packs of wild monkeys wandered through the streets. Over all hung a smothering blanket of dust, smog, and general haze.</p><p>For Basant Chandra, it was a typically frustrating evening commute in the city that he had lived in for his entire forty-seven years. With a population of more than fourteen million, traffic had to be tolerated, and Basant, like everyone else, had learned to cope. On this particular night he was even more tolerant than usual since he was relaxed and content from having stopped for a visit with his favorite call girl, Kaumudi.</p><p>In general, Basant was a lazy, angry, and violent man who felt cheated in this life. Growing up in an upper-caste Kshatriya family, he felt his parents had married him down with a Vaishya woman, despite his father's obtaining a management position at the in-laws' pharmaceutical firm as part of the union, while he was afforded a particularly well-paying sales manager position in place of his previous job selling Tata-brand trucks. The final blow to Basant's self-esteem came with his children, five girls, aged twenty-two, sixteen, twelve, nine, and six. There had been one boy, but his wife had miscarried at five months, for which Basant openly blamed her. In his mind,&#x2014;she'd done it on purpose by overworking as a harried medical doctor, practicing internal medicine at a public hospital. He could remember the day as if it were yesterday. He could have killed her.</p><p>With such thoughts in mind,&nbsp;Basant pounded his steering wheel in frustration as he glided into the reserved parking slot in front of his parents' house, where he and his family lived. It was a soiled three-story concrete structure that had been painted white at some indeterminate time in the past. The roof was flat and the window frames metal. On the first floor was a small office where his wife, Meeta, occasionally saw her few private patients. The rest of the first floor housed his aging parents. Basant and his family occupied the second floor, and his younger brother, Tapasbrati, and his family were on the third.</p><p>As Basant was critically eyeing his house, which was hardly the style that he expected to be living in at this stage of his life, he became aware of a car pulling up behind him, blocking him in. Gazing in the rearview mirror, he had to squint against the car's headlights. All he could make out through the hazy glare was a Mercedes emblem.</p><p>"What the hell?" Basant spat. No one was supposed to park behind him.</p><p>He opened his door and climbed from the car with full intention of walking back and giving the Mercedes's driver a piece of his mind. But he didn't have to. The driver and his two passengers had already alighted and were approaching ominously.</p><p>"Basant Chandra?" the passenger in the lead questioned. He wasn't a big man, but he conveyed an indisputable aura of malevolent authority with his dark complexion, spiked hair, a bad-boy black leather motorcycle jacket over a tight white T-shirt, exposing a powerful, athletic body. Almost as intimidating was the driver. He was huge.</p><p>Basant took a reflexive step back as alarm bells began to sound inside his head. This was no chance meeting. "This is private property," Basant said, trying to sound confident, which he clearly wasn't.</p><p>"That's not the question," the man in the motorcycle jacket said. "The question is: Are you the piece of donkey crap called Basant Chandra?"</p><p>Basant swallowed with some difficulty. His internal alarms were now clanging with the utmost urgency. Maybe he shouldn't have hit the hooker quite so hard. He looked from the Sikh driver to the second passenger, who'd proceeded to pull a gun from his jacket pocket. "I'm Basant Chandra," Basant managed. His voice squeaked, almost unrecognizable to himself. "What's the problem?"</p><p>"You're the problem," the man in the motorcycle jacket said. He pointed over his shoulder. "Get in the car. We've been hired to talk some sense into you. We're going for a little ride."</p><p>"I . . . I . . . I can't go anyplace. My family is waiting for me."</p><p>"Oh, sure!" the apparent leader of the group said with a short, cynical laugh. "That's exactly what we have to talk about. Get in the car before Subrata here loses control and shoots you, which I know he'd prefer to do."</p><p>Basant was now visibly trembling. He desperately looked from one threatening face to the other, then down to the gun in Subrata's hand.</p><p>"Should I shoot him, Sachin?" Subrata asked, raising his silenced automatic pistol.</p><p>"See what I mean?" Sachin questioned, spreading his hands palms up. "Are you going to get into the car or what?"</p><p>Wanting to flee off into the darkness but terrified to do so lest he be shot in the back, Basant forced himself forward, wondering if he should run out into the middle of the congested street. Unable to make up his near-paralyzed mind, he found himself at the black Mercedes, where Subrata opened the passenger-side rear door with his free hand. Subrata forced Basant's head down and his torso into the car before walking around and climbing in on the other side. He was still holding on to his gun and made certain Basant saw that he was.</p><p>Without another word, Sachin and the driver climbed into the front seat. The car pulled out into the street as fast as the congested traffic would allow.</p><p>"To the dump?" the driver asked.</p><p>"To the dump, Suresh," Sachin agreed.</p><p>Acutely aware of the firearm, Basant at first was too terrified to say anything at all, but after ten minutes he was more afraid of not saying anything. His voice wavered at first but then gained some semblance of strength. "What is this all about?" he questioned. "Where are you taking me and why?"</p><p>"We're taking you to the dump," Sachin said, turning around. "It's where we all agreed you belonged."</p><p>"I don't understand," Basant blurted. "I don't know you people."</p><p>"That's going to change, starting tonight."</p><p>Basant felt a modicum of hope. Not that he was happy about the prospect, but Sachin was suggesting a long-term relationship, meaning they weren't going to shoot him. As a drug-sales manager, it crossed his mind that these people might be interested in some kind of drugs. The problem was that Basant had access only to drugs his in-laws' firm made, which were mostly antibiotics, and this kind of shakedown for antibiotics seemed extreme.</p><p>"Is there some way I can help you people?" Basant asked hopefully.</p><p>"Oh, yeah! For sure!" Sachin responded without elaborating.</p><p>They drove in silence for a while. Finally, Basant spoke up. "If you would just tell me, I'll be happy to help in any way I can."</p><p>Sachin swung around and glared at Basant for a beat but didn't speak. Any slight diminution of Basant's encompassing panic evaporated. His trembling returned with a vengeance. His intuition assured him this was not going to end well. When the driver braked to a crawl behind one bullock cart passing another, Basant considered opening the car door, leaping out, and sprinting off into the dark, dusty haze. A glance into Subrata's lap at the nestled gun resulted in a quick response.</p>p&gt;"Don't even think about it," Subrata said, as if reading Basant's mind.<p></p><p>They turned off the main road after another fifteen minutes and headed into the enormous landfill.Through the windows they could see small fires with flames licking up through the mounds of trash, sending spirals of smoke up into the sky. Children could be seen scampering over the debris, looking for food or anything of even questionable value. Rats the size of large rabbits were caught in the headlights as they scurried across the roadway.</p><p>Pulling up between several story-high piles of garbage, the driver made a three-point turn to direct the car back toward the way they'd come. He left the motor running. All three of the toughs climbed out. The driver opened the door for Basant. When Basant didn't respond, the driver reached in and, grabbing a handful of his kurta, dragged him stumbling from the car. Basant couldn't help choking from the smoke and stench. Without letting him go, the driver continued to drag him into the illumination provided by the headlights, where he released him roughly. Basant did all he could do to stay on his feet.</p><p>Sachin, who was pulling a heavy glove on his right hand, walked up to Basant and, before Basant could react, punched him viciously in the face, sending him stumbling backward, losing his balance, and falling into the fetid garbage. With his ears ringing and blood dripping from his nose, he rolled over onto his stomach and tried to get up, but his hands sank into the loose trash. At the same time he felt broken glass cut into the flesh of his left arm. He was yanked by the ankle from the soft garbage out onto the firmly packed truck track. He was then forcibly kicked in the stomach, causing him to lose his wind in the process.</p><p>It took Basant several minutes to catch his breath. When he had, Sachin reached down and grabbed the front of his kurta and yanked him to a sitting position. Basant raised his arms in an attempt to try to shield his face from another blow, but the blow didn't materialize. Hesitantly, he opened his eyes, looking up into the cruel face of his attacker.</p><p>"Now that I have your attention," Sachin snarled, "I want to tell you a few things. We know about you and what kind of piece of shit you are. We know what you've been doing to your oldest daughter, Veena, since she was six. We know you've been keeping her in line by threatening to do the same to her four younger sisters. And we know what you've been doing to her mother."</p><p>"I've never&#x2014;" Basant began but was interrupted by a vicious slap to the face.</p><p>"Don't even try to deny it, you bastard, or I'll beat you to a pulp and leave you here for the rats and the wild dogs to eat."</p><p>Sachin glared down at the cowering Basant before continuing. "This isn't some kind of trial. We know what I'm saying is the truth, you slimy bastard. And I'm going to tell you something. This is a warning! If you ever touch one of your daughters inappropriately or your wife in anger, we will kill you. It's that simple. We've been hired to do it, and knowing what I do about you, I'd just as soon do it and get it over with. So I actually hope you give me the excuse. But that's the message. Any questions? I want to be certain you understand."</p><p>Basant nodded. A glimmer of hope appeared in his terrified mind. This current nightmare was only a warning.</p><p>Sachin unexpectedly slapped Basant once more, sending the man onto his back, his ears ringing and his nose rebleeding.</p><p>Without another word, Sachin took off his leather glove, glared down at Basant for a beat, waved for his companions to follow, and returned to the black Mercedes.</p><p>Sitting up with a sense of utter relief when he realized he was being left, Basant proceeded to get to his feet. A moment later he had to leap back into the loose trash and out of the way as the large sedan surged toward him, missing him by inches. Basant stared after the goons' car while the red taillights receded into the smoke and haze. Only then did he become truly aware of the darkness and stench surrounding him, and the facts that his nose and arm were bleeding, that he'd gathered a small audience of silent, staring landfill urchins, and that the rats were inching closer. With sudden new fear and revulsion, Basant struggled back onto his feet, extricated himself from the soft trash and regained the firmness of the track, all the while grimacing from the pain in his side from the kick he'd suffered. Although it was very difficult to see, because of the moonless night, he hurried forward, hands outstretched like a blind man. He had a long way to walk before reaching a road that would have transportation. It wasn't pleasant and was definitely scary, but at least he was alive.</p></p><h2>Fire Making: The Forgotten Art of Conjuring Flame with Spark, Tinder, and Skill</h2><p><b>A Richly Illustrated Guide to Making Fire <i>Without</i> a Lighter</b><br><br> If you ask outdoorsman Daniel Hume for the fastest, most practical way to start a fire, he&#x2019;ll tell you: Use a match.

[A] near-perfect collection."<br><em>&#x2014;Entertainment Weekly</em></strong><br><br> Rebecca Lee, one of our most gifted and original short story writers, guides readers into a range of landscapes, both foreign and domestic, crafting stories as rich as novels. A student plagiarizes a paper and holds fast to her alibi until she finds herself complicit in the resurrection of one professor's shadowy past. A dinner party becomes the occasion for the dissolution of more than one marriage. A woman is hired to find a wife for the one true soulmate she's ever found. In all, Rebecca Lee traverses the terrain of infidelity, obligation, sacrifice, jealousy, and yet finally, optimism. Showing people at their most vulnerable, Lee creates characters so wonderfully flawed, so driven by their desire, so compelled to make sense of their human condition, that it's impossible not to feel for them when their fragile belief in romantic love, domestic bliss, or academic seclusion fails to provide them with the sort of force field they'd expected.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, June 2013:</strong> How do you judge a short story collection? By its consistency? How often you laugh? Or by the number of times it breaks your heart? With <em>Bobcat and Other Stories</em>, the answer to the last question is seven, which is the number of stories that make up Rebecca Lee's first short story collection (and hopefully far from her last). The title story is perhaps the best example of what Lee does best. An innocuous dinner party reveals to the narrator that her marriage is disintegrating (or were those signs always there?). She says her honeymoon "haunted our marriage a little, mostly because it was a little sad for reasons I couldn't comprehend and felt I shouldn't disturb." <em>Bobcat</em> is a tricky balancing act. Lee has a knack for nuance, but never lets her subtlety dull the emotional punch. Even as her characters wrestle with tragic internal dilemmas, there's a distinct sense of humor that perseveres throughout. <em>Bobcat and Other Stories</em> is one of the strongest collections I've read in recent years. <em>--Kevin Nguyen</em><p><b>Rebecca Lee</b> is professor of creative writing at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, and the author of <i>The City Is a Rising Tide</i>.

To me, something in operatic music encompasses the passion of life. I was recently listening to a great piece: Lakm� by Delibes, which is filled with such emotion, so many layers, that the depth of its expression can send me into ecstasy. It is only fitting that I put it on as I write this chapter.<br><br>I was a vocal performance major with a concentration in operatic studies when I began my early education in academia. Little did I know that what I was learning as a vocalist would apply to arts in the bedroom. I pride myself on being very agile with my tongue, lips, and mouth; and certain techniques that I learned when studying singing helped me become an amazing giver of oral pleasure.<br><br>One of those techniques involved releasing tension. If you get tired before you&#x2019;ve even started the journey of a scintillating, sexy oral session, then tension may be at the root of your exhaustion. Why is tension an enemy when it comes to blowing your partner away?<br><br>Tension Trouble<br><br>1. no flow: When your muscles are holding physical tension, there can be a lack of blood flow and sensation into that tense area. Lack of blood flow means that the body cannot fully arouse, thus you miss out on turning your mouth and your genitals on to their full pleasure potential. Lack of flow also means that there is a lack of deep breath. When you cut off your breath, you cut off your ability to feel more and more &#x201c;oh my god&#x201d; sensations.<br><br>2. no energy: It takes a lot of energy for you to be tense, which is one of the reasons you may tire quickly and easily when it comes to giving oral. Tension steals the energy away from your amazing skills. What good is the skill if you have no endurance to keep going?<br><br>3. no sensuality: If your tongue and mouth are tense, and if your body is tense, it sends a message to your lover that is the opposite of a relaxed sensual space into which he or she can release into ecstasy. Your tension may stop your lover&#x2019;s sensual juices from flowing. Tension is contagious.<br><br>4. no joy: Behind physical tension there is often emotional tension. While not always the case, tension in your body can be an indicator of an emotional issue. And sometimes tension in your body can cause you to feel not so great. When you relax, you bring in joy, love, and passion; so let that tension go.<br><br>How?<br><br>I was on the set of a reality series about �sex-�life makeovers when I met Andy and Lara. They were cast in the show because she �wasn&#x2019;t having orgasms from oral sex. Lara complained that Andy would spend &#x201c;thirty seconds down there&#x201d; and then give up and rush to intercourse. He exclaimed, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s more like thirty minutes!&#x201d; She �hadn&#x2019;t had any issues with having orgasms before meeting Andy, but now it seemed like she&#x2019;d be on the verge of something wonderful right when he would have to stop whatever technique he was doing. Andy explained, &#x201c;I just can&#x2019;t go any longer. I get pain in my neck, in my shoulders, and my chest feels like it&#x2019;s going to collapse!&#x201d; He tensed up his upper body as he said this, lifted his shoulders to his ears, and held his breath so that his face got red and stressed. I thought to myself that if he was doing anything like this display, then tension was playing a big role in his inability to take his time loving Lara with his mouth and tongue and her inability to have an orgasm.<br><br>One of the biggest enemies to a singer and an oral lover is tension: jaw tension, tongue tension, neck and shoulder tension, and (believe it or not) pelvic floor tension too. In many of my singing classes, we were given exercises to help us have an awareness of tension and ways to release tension. The first step is to notice possible tension. Are you clenching your teeth? Are your shoulders up around your ears? Is your tongue curled up in your mouth?<br><br>I asked Andy to think about giving oral sex to Lara while doing the following exercise. I wanted to help him notice if he was already tense, and if he could tense more and then let go completely. As you do this exercise, I want you to do more than notice tension, I want you to also notice what it feels like to be completely relaxed.<br><br>Exercise: The Tension Tester<br><br>To test your tension, try this exercise by actually tensing these areas mentioned below. Tense each specific area as you take a nice deep breath, and then relax as you exhale. Take a moment to notice your body when you complete all the areas mentioned.<br><br>Releasing the Tension<br><br>You may live in a chronically tense state. Most people these days have found stress to be their natural way of being. Fortunately, we also have tools to help us to relax. Here are a few exercises that I have found effective in releasing the tension and helping me to not only improve my singing and speaking voice but also my oral skills. Why? Think about the last time you were giving oral pleasure. Did you find that your jaw started to get tired, or maybe your tongue wore out? I repeat: the culprit is tension.<br><br>Andy was in his early twenties. You would think that he �wouldn&#x2019;t be complaining that every time he went down on his girlfriend he would get pain in his chest, shoulders, and neck. You would think that when Lara was about to have an orgasm, he&#x2019;d be able to keep going instead of having to move because he �couldn&#x2019;t stand the pain any longer. When I watched him practice some of the oral techniques he was using, I found out that he was tensing most of the muscles in his face, neck, and shoulders, and he �wasn&#x2019;t breathing at all. The more stressed he got, the more he tensed; the closer she got to orgasm, the more he&#x2019;d tense. He was caught in a tension loop. And Lara was not a happy �camper&#x2014;�she �wasn&#x2019;t getting any s&#x2019;mores!<br><br>I had to teach Andy how to loosen up and how to improve his flexibility and stamina. A little tongue and mouth Pilates was in order.<br><br>Try these exercises to get loose and free.<br><br>Jaw Loosener<br><br>I have to say that this technique is still hard for me to do. I have a lot of tension in my jaw, which makes it hard for me to let go. It �wasn&#x2019;t surprising that Andy did too; it was next to impossible for him to get this one. But with practice, he started to loosen up a bit.<br><br>Hold your chin between the thumb and forefinger of your dominant hand. Use your fingers to move the bottom of your jaw (mandible) up and down for about thirty seconds. Depending on the level of tension you are holding, you may find this next to impossible. Now, move your hand so that your thumb is on one side and your fingers on the other and try moving your jaw back and forth for a few seconds. Notice if you are holding your breath. Take deep breaths as you try to allow your fingers to move your jaw. Your jaw may pop and snap, especially if you are having TMJ (temporomandibular joint) issues.<br><br>Face and Jaw Yoga<br><br>Don&#x2019;t worry about looking silly for this next one; at least you can do it in private. I was doing it daily with a classroom of people. If you happen to take a class with me, you will join others, looking just as silly as you, all moving their faces like Silly Putty. It&#x2019;s okay; you have permission to be silly. Being silly was hard for Andy, especially since we were doing all this in front of a crew of people with cameras. He was a good sport and played along with me. At the bottom of all this was his desire to please Lara, so he took a risk and looked silly for love.<br><br>Slowly open your mouth as wide as possible as you make different facial expressions while holding your mouth open; you can frown, smile, and even laugh. Now, roll your lips over your teeth as you open your mouth wide. Repeat several times. And finally stretch your jawbones in opposite directions by moving the bottom jaw (mandible) as far to the right as is comfortable, while visualizing the top of your jaw (maxilla) moving to the left, and holding for fifteen seconds, then move the mandible as far to the left as is comfortable, while visualizing the top of your jaw (maxilla) moving to the right and hold for fifteen seconds. Repeat a few times. Make sure that you breathe as you do each of these different stretches. I learned this technique during my first leading role and I never forgot it; I still practice it before every show.<br><br>Tongue Yoga<br><br>Andy actually liked how this one felt. He admitted that he often held his breath during oral, so the breathing and stretching together reminded him to stay relaxed.<br><br>Stick your tongue out as far as it will go and touch the bottom of your chin. You may discover that you have a tongue like the lead singer of KISS or maybe there is tension in this very strong muscle and you can&#x2019;t reach nearly that far. As you reach for the bottom of your chin, take five deep breaths and see if you can let go and stretch a little more. Now stretch your tongue upward to try and touch the tip of your nose. Take five deep breaths. Relax your tongue for a moment and notice how it feels. Now stick out your tongue and try to touch your right ear. Take five deep breaths. And finally move your tongue to the left, trying to touch your left ear. Take five deep breaths. Rest your tongue and notice how it feels.<br><br>Obicularis Oris<br><br>No, obicularis oris (OO) isn&#x2019;t a type of tension; it&#x2019;s a muscle, the kissing muscle to be exact. It is a round �sphincter-�type muscle that surrounds your lips. There are many muscles that move our face and jaw and are responsible for speech and showing of emotion. The OO muscle purses our lips.<br><br>Take a moment to purse your lips like a chimpanzee going in for a big smooch! Take a deep breath, and then open your mouth while trying to hold your lips pursed; notice if there is any tension in your neck or face. Exhale and release your lips and any tension that has crept in as a result of doing the exercise. Now practice rapidly pursing your lips and releasing. Do this about ten times. Notice your level of tension and take a few deep breaths to relax. The objective of this is for you to notice if, when you use your OO muscle, tension is creeping into other areas of your neck and face; you eventually want to keep everything relaxed as you use your lips.<br><br>This one �really helped Andy to feel when tension crept into his neck and shoulders. He would move them when he felt the tension, sometimes even shaking them out while holding his OO muscle in a pucker. Eventually he got to where he could stay relaxed while puckering up!<br><br>The Platysma Stretch<br><br>The platysma is one of my favorite muscles. It is a superficial muscle that runs from the bottom of your collarbone, over your neck, to the bottom of your jaw. This muscle often tries to help when we speak or sing, and as a result it is very hard for some people to relax it. You can feel the platysma tension when you lift your chin and turn your head from side to side. I was in Canada teaching a �sold-�out workshop to a group of couples. One of the first exercises we did was this stretch. I am always pleasantly surprised to hear the gasps of surprise when people discover how much tension they are holding here and how great it feels to release this muscle.<br><br>To get this muscle stretched, anchor your fingertips of both hands underneath your collarbone and pull down, now lift your chin and open and close your mouth. You will feel the stretch when you close your mouth. Take about fifteen seconds with your mouth closed and breathe deeply in and out of your nose.<br>Neck and Shoulder Release<br><br>Andy was definitely not the yoga type. He loved rap music and had a bit of a chip on his shoulder. His life had not been filled with meditation and candlelight. He looked at me like I&#x2019;d just spoken Chinese when I asked him if he&#x2019;d ever used a yoga block. I pulled mine out of my bag and told him to go get one right after our session. It turned out that he got so relaxed he almost fell asleep.<br><br>This is one of my favorites for helping with neck and shoulder tension. For this technique, you will need a yoga block. Lie down on your back on the floor with your knees facing the ceiling and feet flat on the floor. Position the block so that it is long ways, adjacent to your spine. Place one end at the area where the base of your skull meets the spine, otherwise known as the �atlanto-�occipital junction (yep, it&#x2019;s a big word, but don&#x2019;t big words turn you on. Or is it just me?). The other end will fall between your shoulder blades. Hug your arms around yourself and then allow your arms to lie out in a straight line from your body. Hold this position for about five minutes while you deeply breathe; you will feel yourself relax into the block. Do not sit straight up off the block. Gently roll yourself off the block and then lie flat for a few minutes to notice the effects of the practice.<br><br>Now place the block long ways between your shoulder blades. Hug your arms around yourself and open them up so that they are out in a straight line (like a &#x201c;T&#x201d;) from your body. Again, hold this second position for about five minutes while you deeply breathe. When you are finished, roll off the block, then flat onto your back, and notice the effects of the exercise.<br><br>Rolling<br><br>This is a little sensual take on the usual head and shoulder rolling. Begin to roll your head gently to the right with your eyes closed and your mouth slightly open with your jaw relaxed. Now begin to contract and relax your pelvic floor muscles (this includes the muscles you use to stop the flow of urine and your anal sphincter muscles). Repeat to the other direction. Once you have loosened up your neck, try this with each shoulder.<br><br>Massage Techniques<br><br>Andy worked on all the above techniques, but I think his favorites were those that involved massage. I showed him the massage techniques to do on himself, but advised him to incorporate Lara into the massages as a way for them to connect before oral play.</p><h2>OPEN YOUR MIND &amp; BE HEALED</h2><p>Here is Powerful Advice from a Great Woman of Spirit and Soul, Who is Teaching the World How to Stand on Their Own Spiritual Feet. <br><br>For the past 40 years, Rev.

It is this man&#x2019;s incandescent memories&#x2014;of the bleak North African desert, of explorers&#x2019; caves and Bedouin tribesmen,<br>of forbidden love, and of annihilating anger&#x2014;that illuminate the story, and the consequences of the mysteries they reveal radiate outward in shock waves that leave all the characters forever changed.</p><p>Haunting and harrowing, as beautiful as it is disturbing, <i>The English Patient</i> tells the story of the entanglement of four damaged lives in an Italian monastery as World War II ends.

Clementine, her youngest child and a young mother of two small children, has caused Flossy the most worry after enduring a tragically life-altering year. But Samuel and his partner Evan are not far behind in their ability to alarm: their prospective adoption search has just taken a heart-wrenching turn. Only Paige, the eldest of the headstrong Merrill clan, is her usual self: arriving precisely on time with her well-adapted teens. Little does her family know that she, too, is facing personal struggles of her own.<br> <br>No matter. With her family finally congregated under one seaside roof, Flossy is determined to steer her family back on course even as she prepares to reveal the fate of the summer house that everyone has thus far taken for granted: she&#x2019;s selling it. The Merrill children are both shocked and outraged and each returns to memories of their childhoods at their once beloved summer house&#x2014;the house where they have not only grown up, but from which they have grown away. With each lost in their respective heartaches, Clementine, Samuel, and Paige will be forced to reconsider what really matters before they all say goodbye to a house that not only defined their summers, but, ultimately, the ways in which they define themselves.

Throughout the night, driving spring rains had battered against the windowpanes, and flashes of lightning illuminated their bedroom in tumultuous bursts. But now the house was eerily silent. Turning over, she reached for the alarm clock on her bedside table: 7:15. She&#x2019;d never get the kids ready for the school bus on time. Groaning, she slid back beneath the warmth of the down comforter.<br> <br>Outside, the morning light was gauzy. The storm, having dissipated, had given way to slender fingertips of sunlight that stretched across the hardwood floors of her bedroom. Clem turned and pressed her palm to Ben&#x2019;s empty pillow, still creased from where his head had lain. He must&#x2019;ve risen early and gone for a run, which surprised her. The Darby case, which had consumed him for the last several weeks, was finally going to trial next week. They&#x2019;d barely held a conversation outside of household business and the kids because when Ben arrived home, which was almost always late, he was depleted&#x2014;something Clem understood. This was the way things were before a big trial, but she still missed him&#x2014;the simple rituals of filling him in on George and Maddy&#x2019;s days while he stood at the bathroom sink brushing his teeth before bed, or curling up on the couch together with Thai takeout on a Friday night. Ben seemed just beyond her reach. Which was why she was both taken aback and suddenly aroused when he&#x2019;d crawled into bed sometime after midnight and pulled her up against him. They&#x2019;d made love hungrily, like they had not done in some time, and it had filled her limbs with a loose, sweet relief that had led to a dreamless sleep so deep she hadn&#x2019;t heard the remnants of the storm. Or Ben when he&#x2019;d apparently risen that morning. She pressed her nose to the cool surface of his pillowcase and inhaled contentedly.<br> <br>From the hall came the sudden patter of footsteps, and Maddy peeked around the door. &#x201c;Morning, baby,&#x201d; Clem said, pulling the covers aside. George would be in his own bed down the hall, still blanketed in slumber. But not Maddy. She scuttled across the toile duvet like a little animal, all tangled hair and elbows and kneecaps as she tumbled up and over Clem until they were nose to nose.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pancakes?&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>Downstairs, the new coffeemaker burped and spit. It was a hulking stainless-steel contraption, and Clem was in love with it. The newly renovated kitchen of their Cambridge house positively hummed, and Clem would not apologize for the contentment she found in the cool stainless-steel glint of her Viking range and the marble countertops. It was not about the quantifiable substance of the chef-grade haven. Rather, it was the familial refuge she made there: rolling out pastry dough with the kids or plucking a bottle of wine from the rack to pour into her grandmother&#x2019;s Old Galway Claret glasses when friends gathered for one of her casual, leisurely dinners. In this kitchen, she nourished the people she loved most, and from that, she fed herself.<br> <br>Clem had known this was their house since that windy autumn day they&#x2019;d driven by on the way to a doctor&#x2019;s appointment when she was newly pregnant with George. They were lost and late, and she was annoyed with Ben for taking what he had promised her was a shortcut through Cambridge&#x2019;s perplexing street network. She&#x2019;d squealed at first sight of the old Victorian row house, causing Ben to stomp the brakes and pull over, after which she dragged him up the front stoop to peer into the empty first-floor windows.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is it,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d breathed. Ben had shaken his head, but she&#x2019;d felt it just as certainly she would soon feel that unborn baby shifting inside her womb. Eight years and another child later, it was finally renovated. The warm honey-hued hardwoods complemented the understated gray-and-white palette she&#x2019;d chosen alongside their Newton designer, with whom Ben had joked about the kitchen, &#x201c;As long as Clem&#x2019;s happy . . . and saves me whatever she whips up in here when I finally limp home from the office.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d been right; it was the heart of their home, in the heart of their tiny Boston neighborhood. And Clem had never been happier.<br> <br>Now she stood at the churning coffeemaker, mug poised in midair. &#x201c;Slower than a wet week,&#x201d; she mused.<br> <br>&#x201c;But it stopped raining,&#x201d; Maddy replied around a mouthful of pancake. The kids sat at the kitchen island, in differing stages of school-readiness. A glob of syrup dropped onto Maddy&#x2019;s purple skirt. George grimaced and handed her a napkin.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, baby. It&#x2019;s just an expression.&#x201d;<br> <br>The empty lunchboxes gaped at her from the countertop like two hungry mouths. She riffled through the fridge, grabbing American cheese, bread, and two apples. They were out of yogurt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you pack me some chips?&#x201d; George asked, coming to inspect her progress. His breath smelled like toothpaste. Clem planted a kiss on his neatly combed hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure, but eat the fruit first.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maddy considered this. &#x201c;I like to save my fruit for later.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean for the squirrels,&#x201d; George said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not true!&#x201d; Maddy protested. Then, emphatically, &#x201c;I save it for the birds.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fruit first,&#x201d; Clem repeated to both of them as she tossed a small bag of chips into each lunchbox. She glanced at the wall clock. Five minutes until the bus. &#x201c;Maddy, finish your pancake. And go brush your teeth!&#x201d; She grabbed George&#x2019;s sticky plate and set it in the sink.<br> <br>The smell of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe filled the kitchen. Clem quickly filled her coffee mug and then filled one for Ben, setting it aside on the island. He was late, and she silently willed him to make it home before the bus came. Maddy didn&#x2019;t like to leave for school without saying good-bye to her daddy first. And Clem hadn&#x2019;t had enough coffee to navigate a tantrum this early in the day.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shoes!&#x201d; she called, filling their thermoses. What was she forgetting? She checked the calendar over the small kitchen desk that Ben had dubbed her &#x201c;command center.&#x201d; It was strewn with bills and school projects. She squinted at the calendar. George&#x2014;Home Game: 4:00. And there, in red pen below it: Kids&#x2014;Dentist: 4:15.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; she muttered under her breath. She&#x2019;d have to reschedule. Again. She was one reschedule away from having to change dentists all together. Hell, they were probably hoping she would. But she hadn&#x2019;t known that he&#x2019;d have a game when she&#x2019;d made the appointment, and Ben was one of the coaches. Coaching George&#x2019;s team was about the only thing Ben managed to leave the office early for.<br> <br>&#x201c;George,&#x201d; she called into the foyer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m picking you up after school for soccer. It&#x2019;s a game day.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, Mom. But I&#x2019;ll need a note. And my uniform.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; she muttered under her breath again, as she recalled seeing his blue-and-white uniform rolled up in the back of the SUV. &#x201c;Maddy, did you put on shoes?&#x201d;<br> <br>Maddy appeared in the doorway in a pair of strappy yellow wedge sandals, a hand-me-down pair from a neighbor that Clem had deemed the &#x201c;ankle breakers.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, sorry. Not for school,&#x201d; Clem said.<br> <br>Maddy crossed her arms.<br> <br>Clem tossed back her coffee. This was a battle she&#x2019;d have to wage, and win, in the next three minutes. &#x201c;Come on, your Mary Janes are in your cubby.&#x201d; She grabbed the lunchboxes and thermoses from the counter. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll help you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mary Jane is ugly,&#x201d; Maddy mumbled.<br> <br>Clem tried to stifle her laugh. &#x201c;Come sit.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maddy plopped obediently on the antique hall bench but tucked her feet beneath her where Clem could not reach them. Clem wrestled one foot out and pried a scuffed wedge off. By now Ben should not only have come home from his run but be showered and downstairs to help her ferry everyone out to the bus stop. Where was he?<br> <br>Outside, she heard the crunch of tires in the pea-gravel drive. It couldn&#x2019;t be the bus, which pulled up to the curb. But she didn&#x2019;t have time to look to see who it was.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Mom,&#x201d; George said, peering out the front door, &#x201c;is Mrs. Cleary okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Cleary, their elderly neighbor, was known to knock on the door at the most inopportune times, like when one of the kids was spiraling into full-blown meltdown. Or, like now, as she was trying to shepherd everyone out the door and running late. Clem groaned. &#x201c;Is Mrs. Cleary here?&#x201d;<br> <br>George shook his head. &#x201c;No, but there&#x2019;s a police car in her driveway.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clem finished buckling Maddy&#x2019;s shoes and hopped to her feet. Sure enough, a cruiser was parked in the driveway next door.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no siren or lights,&#x201d; George noted solemnly, echoing Clem&#x2019;s thoughts.<br> <br>&#x201c;She probably called them about Rufus again.&#x201d; Mrs. Cleary&#x2019;s terrier, nearly as ancient as she, was prone to wandering out of her yard and up the sidewalk&#x2014;something that sent them all outside: the kids on the hunt for Rufus, and Clem to prevent Mrs. Cleary from falling down on the uneven sidewalk as she tried to catch him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s fine. Now quick: coats! Backpacks!&#x201d;<br> <br>She hurried into the kitchen, jotted a note for George on the school&#x2019;s monogrammed notepad, and scooped up Maddy&#x2019;s coat as she raced back through the foyer.<br> <br>Outside, she was relieved to see the bus rolling up to their mailbox. They&#x2019;d made it! She tucked the note hastily into George&#x2019;s backpack and kissed each of her children good-bye. &#x201c;Love you!&#x201d; she called.<br> <br>Halfway up the bus steps, George stopped and pointed past her. &#x201c;Look.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clem turned, thinking it must be Ben jogging up the sidewalk toward them. But it wasn&#x2019;t her husband.<br> <br>The police car was pulling into their driveway now. Clem blinked. Mrs. Cleary stood on her front porch in her bathrobe. Rufus, she was relieved to see, stood at her feet.<br> <br>The car stopped and an older officer stepped out from behind the driver&#x2019;s seat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom?&#x201d;<br> <br>Behind her the bus engine hummed impatiently. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s nothing,&#x201d; Clem said, turning back to George. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pick you up after school. Have fun today!&#x201d; She waved at the bus driver for good measure and stepped back as the yellow doors slapped shut and the bus moaned, heaving itself back onto the road. Maddy made a silly face from the window, making Clem smile and momentarily forget the squad car parked behind her.<br> <br>When she turned, there were two of them. A petite female officer with her hair pulled back in a ponytail had joined the older officer, who now stepped toward her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse us, ma&#x2019;am. I&#x2019;m Lieutenant Esposito.&#x201d; He flashed his badge and gestured to the young female officer beside him. &#x201c;And this is Officer DeLuca.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clem met them in the middle of the grassy yard, extending her hand to each. &#x201c;Good morning. Can I help you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lieutenant Esposito paused. &#x201c;Do you know Benjamin Edward Dwight?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clem squinted at them in the early morning light. &#x201c;My husband? He went for a run, but I&#x2019;m expecting him home any second.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Is everything all right?&#x201d;<br> <br>Officer DeLuca glanced up at the house, but Lieutenant Esposito met Clem&#x2019;s questioning gaze. His own was gray and watery. &#x201c;Perhaps we could go inside, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Cleary was still watching them from her porch next door. Clem felt a flutter of panic in her chest. What was happening?<br> <br>Officer DeLuca placed a gentle hand on her arm. &#x201c;Mrs. Dwight? We&#x2019;d really like to talk to you inside.&#x201d; And then she understood.<br> <br>Clem&#x2019;s knees buckled. When she put out her hands to signal stop, please stop, the female officer stepped forward and grasped them. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, Mrs. Dwight.&#x201d;<br> <br>But it was not. It was her Ben. Found half an hour ago on the leaf-strewn shoulder of Brattle Street. An ambulance had been called, and he&#x2019;d been transported to Auburn Hospital. They would take her there now. Was there anyone she wanted to call first?<br> <br>An hour later, standing in her sweatpants and the same T-shirt she&#x2019;d slept in, Clem was met by an attending ER doctor in the fluorescent-lit waiting room. She noticed the gold wedding band on his finger, the reassuring sprinkle of gray hair behind his ears. &#x201c;Mrs. Dwight? I&#x2019;m Doctor Sanford.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clem rushed toward him. &#x201c;How is he?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please, come with me.&#x201d; The doctor invited her back through the swinging doors to the long hallway of examination rooms. Clem peered nervously into each sterile doorway they passed. They continued past the first room, then another, until they stopped at a small alcove at the end of the hall, where Dr. Sanford, clipboard in hand, indicated one of several upholstered chairs and asked her to have a seat. She could not.<br> <br>So he stood with her and cleared his throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry, Mrs. Dwight.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ben was gone. The EMTs had tried, to no avail, to resuscitate him on the ambulance ride in. It appeared he&#x2019;d died from a traumatic brain injury incurred by the impact of the car that had struck him on the road that morning. An autopsy would be done to confirm those findings, but Dr. Sanford wanted to reassure her that it was his medical opinion Ben had not suffered.<br> <br>Clem sat down hard. Her first thought was: But he&#x2019;s coaching George&#x2019;s team at four o&#x2019;clock.<br> <br>And then the waiting room went dark.</p><h2>On Another Man&#39;s Wound</h2><p>More than any other book of the period, <i>On Another Man's Wound</i> captures the feel of Ireland&#x2015;the way people lived, their attitudes and beliefs&#x2015;and paints brilliant cameo sketches of the great personalities of the Rising and the War.

Once two particles are entangled, a change to one of them is reflected---<i>instantly---</i>in the other, be they in the same lab or light-years apart. So counterintuitive is this phenomenon and its implications that Einstein himself called it "spooky" and thought that it would lead to the downfall of quantum theory. Yet scientists have since discovered that quantum entanglement, the "God Effect," was one of Einstein's few---and perhaps one of his greatest---mistakes.</p><p><i>What does it mean</i>? The possibilities offered by a fuller understanding of the nature of entanglement read like something out of science fiction: communications devices that could span the stars, codes that cannot be broken, computers that dwarf today's machines in speed and power, teleportation, and more. </p><p>In <i>The God Effect</i>, veteran science writer Brian Clegg has written an exceptionally readable and fascinating (and equation-free) account of entanglement, its history, and its application. Fans of Brian Greene and Amir Aczel and those interested in the marvelous possibilities coming down the quantum physics road will find much to marvel, illuminate, and delight.</p></p><p><p>"A marvelously clear and engaging account of the people and ideas involved in trying to understand the deepest mysteries of the quantum world and convert them into a useful technology."<br>---Gregory Chaitin, author of <i>Meta</i><i> Math!

A physical phenomenon so strange and all pervasive that this book calls it the &#x2018;God Effect,' entanglement leaves common sense shattered."<br>---from <i>The God Effect</i></p><p>If you've ever wondered whether mankind might someday communicate across the vast distances between the stars, develop codes that cannot be broken, devise computers that would make finding a needle in a haystack trivial, or even learn to create teleportation, then the amazing science portrayed in Brian Clegg's <i>The God Effect</i> will astound and fascinate with its portrayal of a universe---our own---so strange that imagination can scarcely suffice to grasp it.</p><p>Brian Clegg is the author of <i>A Brief History of Infinity</i>, <i>The First Scientist: A Life of Roger Bacon</i>, and <i>Light Years: The Extraordinary Story of Mankind's Fascination with Light</i>.

Today there continues to be a number of unresolved issues between the Protestant and Catholic churches, and many experience this ongoing division within their family and among friends and neighbors.Written in an accessible and informative style, Gregg Allison and Chris Castaldo provide a brief and clear guide to the key points of unity and divergence between Protestants and Catholics today. They write to encourage fruitful conversation about the key theological and sociological differences between the two largest branches of Christianity.From the revolutionary events 500 years ago that sparked the Reformation to today, Unfinished Reformation takes a nuanced and thoughtful look at doctrine, practice, and how Protestants and Catholics can have fruitful discussions about the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><p><p>Gregg Allison (PhD) is Professor of Christian Theology at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky where he teaches systematic theology.&nbsp; Previously he served on Cru staff at the University of Notre Dame and overseas in Italy and the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland. He is a pastor of Sojourn Community Church, and is the theological strategist for Sojourn Network, a church planting network of about thirty churches. He is the author of <em>Historical Theology: An Introduction to Christian Doctrine</em>; <em>Sojourners and Strangers: The Doctrine of the Church</em>; and <em>Roman Catholic Theology and Practice: An Evangelical Assessment.</em></p><br><br><p>Chris Castaldo (PhD) was raised on Long Island, New York, as a Roman Catholic and worked full-time in the Catholic Church for several years. After eight years as pastor of outreach and church planting at College Church (Wheaton, Ill.), followed by three years as Director of the Ministry of Gospel Renewal at Wheaton College, Chris currently serves as Lead Pastor of New Covenant Church in Naperville, IL.&nbsp; He is the author of <em>Holy Ground: Walking with Jesus as a Former Catholic</em> and <em>Talking with Catholics about the Gospel: A Guide for Evangelicals</em>. Chris blogs at www.chriscastaldo.com</p>Many Christians are aware that there a fundamental differences between Protestants and Roman Catholics but are unsure exactly what these differences are or how much they really matter. Some may regard them as trivial while others may struggle to see how there can be Christians in both groups. The Unfinished Reformation sets out clearly and simply where the differences lie. The differences are not minimised, but nor are they magnified. Where Protestants have often misrepresented Roman Catholics this is pointed out. At the same time there is no pretence that no differences exist. This book is to be warmly commended to those wishing to understand these issues better. -- Tony Lane, Professor of Historical Theology, London School of Theology<br><br>What Gregg Allison and Chris Castaldo have done in this important book is unique: they carefully explore the many areas where Protestants and Catholics agree but also disagree. I've seen exhortations to unity, and I've seen polemics for division, but I've never seen one volume deal so well with both commonality and also disagreement. Knowing their personal ministry, though, I'm not surprised that Allison and Castaldo exhibit such grace alongside truth. -- Collin Hansen, editorial director, The Gospel Coalition<br><br>Allison and Castaldo have provided a book that is both timely and thoughtful---a book that at the same time looks fondly on the Reformation yet asks the important question of these reforms for today. Their approach is especially sensitive to the realities of divided families, one Catholic and one Protestant, yet aware of how Catholics and Protestants find themselves united on struggles to end abortion. This is a book that will educate the novice and provoke thought in the expert. -- Ryan M. Reeves, Associate Professor of Historical Theology and Dean of Jacksonville Campus of Gordon-Conwell<br><br>The Unfinished Reformation is an accessible, well-written explanation of Catholic beliefs, Protestant beliefs, and how the two relate. The layperson can read this book and feel equipped to have well-rounded conversations about faith with his Catholic or Protestant neighbor about matters of faith. -- Ed Stetzer, Billy Graham Distinguished Chair, Wheaton College<br><br>This book is a model of gracious and principled dialog, as much for its tone as its content. Heartily recommended for all who care about theology and the particular conversation between evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholics. -- Gerald Hiestand, Executive Director, The Center for Pastor Theologians<br><br>This is the best treatment I have read on understanding what continues to unite and divide Catholics and Protestants. While considering the historic roots of the Reformation in the sixteenth century, Gregg Allison and Chris Castaldo also remain sensitive to the significant doctrinal shifts of the twentieth century and our contemporary context. They are informed but not pedantic, accessible but not simplistic. Both scholar and layperson will benefit. I heartily recommend this book to Catholics and Protestants alike who desire an honest and thoughtful way to approach the other side of the 'divided family.' -- Rev. Dr. Camden M. Bucey, President, Reformed Forum; Pastor, Hope Orthodox Presbyterian Church, Grayslake, Illinois<br><br>This book blows a welcome breeze into the stifling and oppressive debates between Protestants and Catholics. Too often, each side labels the other a &#x2018;false church&#x2019; and refuses to see the good the other tradition offers. Allison and Castaldo refuse to be this simplistic---not to mention uncharitable---in their approach. Congenial in their tolerance while never obscuring real differences, the authors lay out the main points of disagreement between these two Christian traditions. If you are a Protestant with a Catholic in your life, or vice versa, you need this book in your library. -- Bryan M.

It was in these decades that the enduring legacy of Frank Sinatra was forged, and Kaplan vividly captures &#x201c;Ol&#x2019; Blue Eyes&#x201d; in his later years. The sequel to the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling <i>Frank,</i> here is the concluding volume of the definitive biography of "The Entertainer of the Century."</p><p>James Kaplan has been writing about people and ideas in business and popular culture, as well as notable fiction (<i>The Best American Short Stories</i>), for more than three decades. His essays and reviews, as well as more than a hundred major profiles, have appeared in many magazines, including <i>The New Yorker, </i>the <i>New York Times Magazine, Vanity Fair, Esquire,</i> and <i>New York</i>.

He lives in Westchester, New York, with his wife and three sons.Act One<br> The Whirlwind<br><br> 1<br> Eleven days after winning the Oscar for&nbsp;<i>From Here to Eternity</i>, Frank Sinatra sat down and typed a note to a friend, clearly in response to a congratulatory letter or telegram. The note, on&nbsp;Paramount Pictures stationery and in Frank&#x2019;s customary, too-impatient-to-press-the-shift-key style, began,<br> &nbsp;<br> april 5, 1954<br> dear lew&#x2014;<br> my paisan mr sinatra is still on cloud nine and the bum refuses to come down...<br> &nbsp;<br> That bum&#x2014;&#x201c;mr sinatra&#x201d;&#x2014;was so thrilled, the note continued (still all lowercase, still in the third person), that he was &#x201c;ridiculous.&#x201d; And then, after a final thanks to the recipient, came the signature: &#x201c;maggio.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a charming letter and a fascinating one.&nbsp;Throughout his life, Sinatra employed secretaries who answered his voluminous mail, often signing his name themselves. From time to time, though, when the spirit moved him, he penned or typed his own missives, and the letters are&nbsp;<i>him</i>, revealing his restless intellect, his&nbsp;sense of humor (always more spontaneous in personal circumstances than onstage), even a literary sensibility. And why not? As a great singer, he was a great storyteller; why should that faculty switch off when he was away from a microphone? In this note, he is writing in character, as PFC Angelo Maggio, the role that won him that&nbsp;Academy Award, and the voice is perfect: &#x201c;the bum refuses&#x201d;; &#x201c;he&#x2019;s so thrilled he is ridiculous.&#x201d; From&nbsp;the moment he&#x2019;d first picked up&nbsp;James Jones&#x2019;s blockbuster novel,&nbsp;Sinatra had completely identified with Maggio, the feisty little private from Brooklyn who speaks in a kind of Damon Runyon&#x2013;ese. He had campaigned, hard, for the movie role by barraging the filmmakers&#x2014;Columbia Pictures president&nbsp;Harry&nbsp;Cohn; producer&nbsp;Buddy Adler; director&nbsp;Fred Zinnemann; screenwriter&nbsp;Daniel Taradash&#x2014;with telegrams touting his perfect suitability for the part, and he had signed every wire just as he&#x2019;d signed this note: &#x201c;Maggio.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Frank Sinatra had identified so powerfully with the character not only because Angelo Maggio was a skinny, streetwise Italian-American from Brooklyn&#x2014;like Sinatra&#x2019;s native&nbsp;Hoboken, close geographically to Manhattan but oh so far away&#x2014;but also because Maggio was one of the world&#x2019;s downtrodden, a little man who drank to ease his sorrows and spoke truth to power with wisecracks. When Sinatra first read&nbsp;<i>From Here to Eternity</i>&nbsp;in late 1951, he was feeling considerably downtrodden himself. His records were no longer selling; he was having vocal and financial problems; the IRS was after him. He had become infamous, pilloried in newspapers across the United States, after leaving his wife and three children for Ava Gardner.&nbsp;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had recently terminated his movie contract, and he would soon also be dumped by&nbsp;Columbia Records, as well as by his talent agency, the Music Corporation of America.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a dead man,&#x201d; the talent agent Irving &#x201c;Swifty&#x201d;&nbsp;Lazar declared in 1952. &#x201c;Even Jesus couldn&#x2019;t get resurrected in this town.&#x201d; Maybe not, but Frank Sinatra could. Literally overnight&#x2014;after the&nbsp;Academy Awards ceremony on March 25,&nbsp;1954&#x2014;Sinatra brought off the greatest comeback in show-business history. And he had done it all in Hollywood, a ruthlessly Darwinian company town that reviles losers but has the sappiest of soft spots for a happy ending. His Oscar underlined the fact that he was also a freshly viable recording artist with a new contract at Capitol Records, where he and a brilliant young arranger named&nbsp;Nelson&nbsp;Riddle had begun creating the string of groundbreaking recordings that would revolutionize popular music in the 1950s.<br> &nbsp;<br> And quite suddenly that spring, without a shred of embarrassment about its fickleness, the entire entertainment industry began throwing itself at his feet. &#x201c;The whole world is changing for Frank Sinatra,&#x201d;&nbsp;Louella Parsons wrote in her syndicated column of April 19. &#x201c;Today he has so many jobs offered him he can pick and choose.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Parsons was talking about movies, although television, radio, and nightclubs&nbsp;were also calling. Among the film possibilities offered to Sinatra: a supporting part alongside the hot-as-a-pistol young&nbsp;Robert Mitchum in the medical melodrama&nbsp;<i>Not as a Stranger;</i>&nbsp;the second lead in a&nbsp;Warner Bros. remake of&nbsp;<i>Four Daughters</i>, the picture that had catapulted&nbsp;John Garfield to fame; a co-starring role alongside Marilyn Monroe in the&nbsp;20th Century Fox musical&nbsp;<i>Pink Tights</i>, even though Monroe soon dropped out when she heard how much more the studio was offering&nbsp;Sinatra than her. And, lo and behold, MGM&#x2014;where&nbsp;Louis B. Mayer had personally fired Sinatra in 1950 after he made an impolitic joke about Mayer&#x2019;s mistress (and where Mayer himself was now history)&#x2014;wanted him back, for the long-discussed&nbsp;<i>St. Louis Woman</i>, alongside Ava Gardner.<br> &nbsp;<br> This was distinctly problematic for several reasons. For one thing, Gardner, who&#x2019;d been outraged that&nbsp;Metro had dubbed a professional singer&#x2019;s voice over hers in&nbsp;<i>Show Boat</i>, was determined never to make another musical. For another, she had come to hate&nbsp;Hollywood with a passion. She was living as an expatriate, cohabiting in&nbsp;Spain with the charismatic and brilliant bullfighter Luis Miguel Domingu�n, the darkly handsome torero whose rivalry with his brother-in-law&nbsp;Antonio Ord��ez would later inspire&nbsp;Ernest Hemingway&#x2019;s long<i> Life</i>&nbsp;magazine piece&nbsp;<i>The Dangerous Summer</i>. Most important of all, however, she was about to file for divorce from Frank.<br> &#x2014;<br> While the Hollywood of 1954 bore some similarities to today&#x2019;s entertainment capital, it was altogether a sleepier, more rustic town. Not a more virtuous one by any means, but more tightly bounded. The studios still held sway; their publicity departments controlled access to stars and information about them, even when it came to police matters. There was a certain code of conduct for the press and other prying outsiders when it came to celebrities.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is, for example, impossible to imagine any major star today living, as Sinatra did in the spring of that year, in a garden apartment, albeit such a glamorous one as Frank&#x2019;s five-room bachelor pad in a redbrick complex at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Beverly Glen. A decade before, when he had first come to Hollywood, he had resided in a pink-walled stucco mansion in&nbsp;Toluca Lake. It was a mark of both his change of fortunes and his maturity (not to mention the change of times) that Sinatra no longer had to ward off hordes of bobby-soxers, or hordes of any kind. In the spring of 1954, he was approaching thirty-nine&#x2014;lean and balding, not settled by any means (his defiant hedonism and overweening ego would guard against such a fate for a very long time), but grown up, in his own particular way. His oaken baritone on the&nbsp;Capitol recordings, rich with sad knowledge&#x2014;or, on up-tempo numbers, with swaggering authority&#x2014;was a sea change from the tender Voice that had soothed America through the war.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the secret was that he was still yearning. (He would always yearn, even after he had gained all the world had to offer.) He had spent the previous Christmas and New Year&#x2019;s in&nbsp;Rome, where Gardner was shooting&nbsp;Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Barefoot Contessa</i>, desperately trying to hold on to her, even as she was edging away, already in love with the bullfighter. Ava loved Frank too&#x2014;she always would&#x2014;but her passion for him had ebbed, diminished in good part by his plummet from success, which had coincided with her own rise to stardom. He had drained her scant reserves of patience and sympathy. Unknown to her, just before she left for Europe the previous November, he had made a serious&nbsp;suicide attempt, cutting his left wrist in the New York apartment of his close friend the songwriter Jimmy Van Heusen: he would have bled out had Van Heusen not returned and found him.<br> &nbsp;<br> And Ava smelled his desperation and hated it even as she loved him. She was heedless and restless and easily bored, and she was in love with another man.<br> &nbsp;<br> The gossip columnists (Sinatra read them as closely as any fan) cobbled up a sweet fantasy: Gardner would come to the Oscars that March&#x2014;she herself was up for Best Actress, for&nbsp;<i>Mogambo</i>&#x2014;and the couple would reunite. But she stayed with her lover in&nbsp;Spain.<br> &nbsp;<br> If Frank himself had harbored any fantasy that his renewed fame would bring her back, he was rudely disappointed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One night we went to Frank&#x2019;s for a dinner party,&#x201d; recalled the lyricist and screenwriter&nbsp;Betty Comden, &#x201c;and we saw that one of the rooms was filled with pictures of Ava, and around the pictures were lit candles. It was like the altar of a little church.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet another night, Gardner&#x2019;s biographer&nbsp;Lee Server writes, Swifty&nbsp;Lazar, who lived in the same apartment complex as Sinatra, came home late and saw that Frank&#x2019;s door was open.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wondering if there was a problem, he stuck his head through the doorway and saw Sinatra by himself, evidently very drunk, slumped in an armchair, holding a gun. Cautiously Lazar stepped inside and as he did he saw that Sinatra was aiming his gun&#x2014;an air gun, it turned out to be&#x2014;at three large portrait images of Ava he had propped up on the floor. The three faces of Ava were full of pellet holes where Sinatra had been shooting at them&#x2014;all night long, as it appeared.<br> &nbsp;<br> If Gardner had been Delilah to Frank&#x2019;s Samson while they were together, she would be his muse for years after they broke up&#x2014;specifically and crucially,&nbsp;the great&nbsp;Capitol years. &#x201c;Ava taught him how to sing a torch song,&#x201d; Nelson Riddle famously said. &#x201c;She taught him the hard way.&#x201d; On May 13, 1954,&nbsp;Sinatra&#x2014;with Riddle conducting a twenty-nine-piece orchestra&#x2014;recorded three songs that could have been addressed directly to his wandering wife: &#x201c;The&nbsp;Gal That Got Away,&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Half as Lovely (Twice as True),&#x201d; and&nbsp;&#x201c;It Worries Me.&#x201d; On the last, Frank sang,<br> &nbsp;<br> <i> Just what did I do&#x2014;was I mean to you?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Taken as autobiography (which to some extent it must be), the lyric may look disingenuous&#x2014;of course he had been not just mean but brutal to her, and she to him, on innumerable occasions. But listened to, the line, sung with exquisite tenderness, is meltingly lovely. In fact, Frank in his new middle period was every bit the ballad singer that Frankie of the&nbsp;Columbia years had been&#x2014;and then some. He had lived more, suffered more.<br> &#x2014;<br> On June 12, 1954, Ava&nbsp;Gardner arrived in Lake Tahoe to begin the six-week Nevada residence required for her divorce from Frank Sinatra.&nbsp;Las Vegas, where&nbsp;she had sojourned while splitting from her first husband,&nbsp;Mickey Rooney, was out; Frank was in town, playing the Sands, and Vegas was a small place in those days. (And, extraordinarily enough, both Rooney and Gardner&#x2019;s second husband, Artie&nbsp;Shaw, were also appearing at casinos along the Strip: a constellation of exes.)<br> &nbsp;<br> While in Tahoe, Ava and her maid,&nbsp;Reenie Jordan, stayed in a lakefront house provided by her inveterate suitor, the epically weird, immensely wealthy oil and aviation magnate Howard&nbsp;Hughes. Hughes, a control freak to the nth degree and a paranoiac master of intrigue, especially when it came to affairs of the heart, had a habit of installing girlfriends&#x2014;both current and prospective&#x2014;in rented houses, sometimes in proximity to each other, the better to monitor their comings and goings. For years, he had been trying to reel in Gardner, to bed or to wed, without success. He showered her with expensive gifts, jewels and fur coats and convertibles; she accepted his presents and laughed in his face.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now he sensed an opening. Her marriage was ending; perhaps she needed a shoulder to cry on. But the emotionally tone-deaf Hughes needed data to press his campaign. He had the rented house bugged and retained a fancy Washington, D.C., investigator named&nbsp;Robert Maheu to surveil the premises while Ava was in residence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Maheu, whose specialty was high-level cloak-and-dagger work (in later years, he would be intimately involved in a&nbsp;CIA-backed plot to assassinate Fidel Castro),&nbsp;was understandably loath to make a long trip for what was plainly a jealous-boyfriend job. He subcontracted the work to a local private detective, who quickly ascertained that Hughes&#x2019;s competition was Ava&#x2019;s never-say-die, soon-to-be ex.<br> &nbsp;<br> One afternoon that summer, Frank showed up at the Tahoe house, no doubt with reconciliation in mind, and managed to persuade Ava to take a boat ride with him. Unwisely, the local detective elected to follow them in another boat. Sinatra quickly spotted him and gave furious chase; the detective just managed to make it back to shore and hightail it into the woods.&nbsp;Any hint of romance thoroughly spoiled, Frank left Tahoe without swaying Ava.<br> &nbsp;<br> Romantic history: first as tragedy, then as farce.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the end of July, she failed to show up for her court date for the divorce. She had asked him to repay the not inconsiderable sums she&#x2019;d lent him when he was down-and-out; he had bridled at the request. They were at an impasse: still legally married, though apart. He would never get her out of his system, nor would she ever truly get him out of hers.</p><h2>The People&#39;s Guide to Mexico</h2><p>Over the past 35 years, hundreds of thousands of readers have agreed: This is <i>the</i> classic guide to "living, traveling, and taking things as they come" in Mexico.

The warm, easygoing style and personal insights of the writer/editor team have inspired generations of travelers. When not on the road?or living somewhere in Mexico?they can usually be found in their pioneer-era log cabin in the North Cascade Mountains.<br><br>Exploring Mexico with Carl Franz &amp; Lorena Havens<br><br><b>1. This is the 14th edition of <i>The People's Guide to Mexico</i>. Please tell us the story of how this book came to be.</b><br><br><i>The People&#x2019;s Guide to Mexico</i> began on a Mexican beach in 1970 as a series of detailed letters to friends in Alaska who were eager to join up with Lorena, Steve and myself on our first major van odyssey through Mexico. It developed further through storytelling around countless campfires as we traveled on to Guatemala, El Salvador and Belize. <br><br>There were no guidebooks at the time that explained how to travel in Mexico and Central America in more than general terms. Our friends and other travelers constantly peppered us with practical questions how to take a local bus, where to eat cheaply, how to find a budget hotel room and more. With Steve looking over my shoulder and contributing his vast personal experience, I started hammering away on my Olympia portable typewriter. I was easily bored, however, and tended to drift off-topic into stories about our current adventures. Lorena applied her organizational skills in an attempt to keep me focused.<br><br>In a small house overlooking Lake Atitlan the manuscript piled beside me eventually reached over one thousand typewritten pages. It became apparent that things had gotten out of hand. Was it a book? Everyone we asked said the answer was obviously, No!&#x201d; Who would possibly publish an unknown author writing about off-beat Mexico? <br><br>On our slow return northward, we visited John and Eve Muir in San Miguel de Allende. John&#x2019;s book, <i>How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive</i> was selling like crazy and he&#x2019;d decided to start his own publishing company. He and Eve took a quick look at our manuscript the rest, as they say, is history.<br><br><b>2. How has traveling in Mexico changed since the 70's and how is the travel experience the same?</b><br><br>There is no aspect of traveling in Mexico that hasn&#x2019;t changed dramatically since the seventies, at least in a practical sense. In those days, for example, there were almost no road or directional signs, even on major highways. It wasn&#x2019;t just easy to get lost and confused, it was inevitable; an integral part of the Mexican experience. <br><br>People weren&#x2019;t used to seeing foreign travelers outside of the most obvious tourist attractions and resorts. Anyone who didn&#x2019;t look like the typical gringo resort-hopping tourist drew a lot of attention, some of it definitely unwanted (especially from the police).<br> <br>Mexico&#x2019;s public service infrastructure was very weak and unreliable it often took hours and a lot of pesos to make an international phone call. Changing traveler&#x2019;s checks was a drag.<br><br>Of all the changes we&#x2019;ve seen, however, I don&#x2019;t think anything can top the arrival of the internet and cell phones. Second on the list would be the tremendous improvement in highways and transportation.<br>What hasn&#x2019;t changed in Mexico, or not as much? The hospitality and generosity of the Mexican people, as well as their incredible sense of humor. <br><br><b>3. <i>The People&#x2019;s Guide to Mexico</i> is often cited as one of the books that launched the independent travel movement. What is your reaction to this?</b><br><br>Since the <i>People&#x2019;s Guide</i> was first published in 1972, we&#x2019;ve received thousands of letters, emails and personal testimonials from people who say that the book gave them the confidence and tools they needed to visit Mexico. So, yes, in that sense we did inspire others to grab a backpack or a suitcase and head out. It isn&#x2019;t easy to remember, but in the sixties and early seventies tourism outside of the U.S. was almost exclusively for people with money. The People&#x2019;s Guide was for the rest of us independents&#x201d; with more time than money, along with a strong curiosity and appreciation for the real&#x201d; Mexico. <br><br>As an aside, one of the most gratifying compliments we heard in the book&#x2019;s early days was from travelers who recommended it for travel to India and Asia. <i>The People&#x2019;s Guide</i> is the best guidebook to travel in the Third World.&#x201d; was the way one person put it.<br><br><b>4. What's the one site/activity/experience in Mexico that should be on a traveler's "bucket list"?</b><br><br>My bucket list&#x201d; tends to be filled with apparently ordinary experiences that travelers ordinarily do not think of when away from home. For example, I&#x2019;ve had haircuts in small town barbershops in Mexico, India and other countries. It&#x2019;s an experience I don&#x2019;t necessarily want to repeat but one I seldom forget. <br><br>If you are near a beach, there&#x2019;s nothing more Mexican than spending an entire afternoon in a seaside restaurant, eating and drinking your way through the menu, one delicious dish after another. Hire a taxi for an hour in any mid-sized city and ask the driver to show you the sights. I can&#x2019;t pass up a Mexican hardware store or street market without looking for handmade tools and ingenious mouse traps.<br><br>Lorena&#x2019;s suggestion is to take a morning bus to a small town you&#x2019;ve never heard of, eat breakfast there, have your shoes shined and wander the streets. Lorena looks for yarn and interesting little gifts as an excuse to poke her head in small shops. Smile a lot.<br></p><h2>The Best of James Whitcomb Riley</h2><p><p>The best-loved poems by the "Hoosier Poet" are here collected to read and cherish time and time again.

Danu Forest's guidance chimes closely with my own experience of working with spirits over many years. Integrating folk traditions, literary sources and archaeology with contemporary practice, Danu combines visually strong and spiritually apposite ideas with sensitive advice concerning our relations with spirit, as well as working with sacred sites. As Danu says, how we perceive the spirits we connect with as Druids does make a difference. Having been plugging the notion of Druidry as the native 'shamanic' tradition of Britain and Europe since 1974, it's good to see that it's increasingly catching on, not only amongst fellow Druids, but also amongst archaeologists. I believe we are heading in a direction that links us very firmly with the spirit of ancient Druidry. This is what I call rekindling the sacred fire of Druidry, and I believe Danu Forest's 'The Druid Shaman' will play a part in this rekindling.<br>--Philip Shallcrass - 'Greywolf' Chief of the British Druid Order.<br></td></tr></tbody></table></p><h2>Attaching in Adoption: Practical Tools for Today&#39;s Parents</h2><p>Attaching in Adoption is a comprehensive guide for prospective and actual adoptive parents on how to understand and care for their adopted child and promote healthy attachment.

Maschmann wrote to Hannah Arendt that her intent in writing this memoir was to help her former Nazi colleagues think about their actions, and to help others &#x201c;better understand&#x201d; why people like her had been drawn to Hitler. Written as a letter to an unnamed Jewish girl, this memoir details the trajectory of a socially-conscious, well-educated, middle-class girl as she joins the Hitler Youth, supervises the eviction of Polish farmers from their land and works in the high echelons of Nazi press and propaganda. Arrested in 1945 at the age of 33, Maschmann completed mandatory de-Nazification and became a freelance journalist. This edition includes a new introduction explaining how the Publishers identified Maschmann&#x2019;s high school Jewish friend, Marianne Schweitzer Burkenroad, born in 1918 and located her in California. In an afterword, she recounts for the first time her friendship with Maschmann and her reactions to Account Rendered.</p><p> </p><p>&#x201c;[<i>Account Rendered</i> is an] important document of its time [...] I have the impression that you are totally sincere, otherwise I wouldn&#x2019;t have written back to you.&#x201d; &#x2014; letter from <b>Hannah Arendt</b> to Melita Maschmann</p><p> </p><p>&#x201c;[A] soul-searching record in which [Melita Maschmann] attempts to state and understand her guilt as a Nazi... her account here is intelligent and convincing.&#x201d; &#x2014; <b>Kirkus Reviews</b></p><p> </p><p>&#x201c;There weren&#x2019;t a lot of books by former Nazis in the Sixties. I found in [<i>Account Rendered</i>] someone who had been overtaken by history, was struggling to make sense of what no longer made sense, and to understand why it had once done so. In other books, the Jews were an abstraction. For Maschmann, the Jews were neighbors and friends, which complicated the process of dehumanization that she participated in.

She joined the BDM (Bund Deutscher M�del, the Girls&#x2019; Section of the Hitler Youth) secretly in 1933 against the wishes of her parents who were conservative and nationalist, but not national-socialist. She worked for the Labor Service in East Prussia (1936-37), then as a journalist for the press section of the BDM (1937-41) in Frankfurt-an-der-Oder and in the Wartheland (German-occupied Poland). She was in charge of women&#x2019;s Labor Service camps in Poland and Germany (1941-43) and responsible for the BDM&#x2019;s press and propaganda division in Berlin (1943-45). She did war work, including preparation for &#x201c;Werewolf&#x201d; (S.S. sabotage) activities (1945) before the US Army captured her in Austria in July 1945 with a clandestine group manufacturing false documents for &#x201c;comrades&#x201d;. She was interned in the &#x201c;Frauenlager 77&#x201d; (internment camp for women) near Ludwigsburg, and later in Darmstadt until 1948. Denazification authorities considered her a &#x201c;follower&#x201d; (&#x201c;indoctrinated&#x201d; and too young to be fully responsible); Maschmann finally broke with National Socialism only in the 1950s. After her release, Maschmann wrote for the Darmst�dter Echo and the Frankfurter Rundschau. She travelled to Afghanistan and India in 1962-63 and moved permanently to India shortly thereafter, becoming a follower of Guru Sri Anandamayi Ma. In India, Maschmann lived mainly in her ashrams, and after Sri Anandamayi Ma&#x2019;s death in 1982, worked in institutions for children. She returned to Darmstadt in 1998 due to Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and died in a retirement home. She was never married and had no children. Account Rendered was first published in 1963 as Fazit: Kein Rechtfertigungsversuch (No attempt at justification), translated into several languages, and republished seven times in Germany where it became a required high school text. Maschmann also wrote fiction (Die Aschenspur, Der Dreizehnte, Das Wort Hiess Liebe) and books about Sri Anandamayi Ma and India (Der Tiger singt Kirtana, Indiras Schwestern, Eine ganz gew�hnliche Heilige).</p><h2>Death Times Three (Nero Wolfe)</h2><p><b>Murder strikes thrice in these three baffling mysteries of crime and detection.</b><br><br>First, Rex Stout&#x2019;s great detective, Nero Wolfe, develops an appetite for the sweet taste of revenge when someone slips something most foul into his lunch&#x2014;in a case motivated by the most &#x201c;alimentary&#x201d; of passions.

Craig Lockard shows how for several millennia Southeast Asians, living at the crossroads of Asia, enjoyed ever expanding connections to both China and India, and later developed maritime trading networks to the Middle East and Europe. He explores how the people of the region combined local and imported ideas to form unique cultures, reflected in such striking creations as Malay sailing craft, Javanese gamelan music, and batik cloth, classical Burmese and Cambodian architecture, and social structures in which women have often played unusually influential roles. Lockard describes colonization by Europeans and Americans between 1500 and 1914, tracing how the social, economic, and political frameworks inherited from the past, combined with active opposition to domination by foreign powers, enabled Southeast Asians to overcome many challenges and regain their independence after World War II. The book also relates how Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam are now among the fastest growing economies in the world and play a critical role in today's global marketplace.<br></p><p><br><strong>Craig Lockard</strong> is Ben and Joyce Rosenberg Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.<br>Lockard&#39;s Southeast Asia in World History must be welcomed as a fascinating addition to the literature on Southeast Asian Studies as well as World History ... an invaluable resource for anyone who has an interest in Southeast Asia. * Yosef Djakababa, Journal of Asian Studies *</p><h2>Basics of Assessment: A Primer for Early Childhood Professionals (Basics series)</h2><p><b>Assessment of children's abilities and knowledge, their approaches to learning, and their strengths, needs, and interests is expected in most early childhood programs.</b> However, many early childhood educators are unsure of how to assess young children's development and learning.

She believes in centering the voices of historically minoritized people in higher education. One way in which she puts this value into practice is through research that fosters equitable campus environments, with an explicit focus on race and gender. Her research is informed by her work in a campus-based women&#x2019;s center, where she supported survivors of sexual violence. Most recently, her research has focused on ways campus activists use their voices to elevate sexual violence as an important national issue. As a power-conscious educator, Chris also works to expose power in dominant narratives.

What about whether Plan B, the morning-after pill, is sold at the local pharmacy? Many people assume such important and controversial policy decisions originate in the halls of Congress. But the choreographed actions of Congress and the president account for only a small portion of the laws created in the United States. By some estimates, more than ninety percent of law is created by administrative rules issued by federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services, where unelected bureaucrats with particular policy goals and preferences respond to the incentives created by a complex, procedure-bound rulemaking process.<br> <br> With <i>Bending the Rules</i>, Rachel Augustine Potter shows that rulemaking is not the rote administrative activity it is commonly imagined to be but rather an intensely political activity in its own right. Because rulemaking occurs in a separation of powers system, bureaucrats are not free to implement their preferred policies unimpeded: the president, Congress, and the courts can all get involved in the process, often at the bidding of affected interest groups. However, rather than capitulating to demands, bureaucrats routinely employ &#x201c;procedural politicking,&#x201d; using their deep knowledge of the process to strategically insulate their proposals from political scrutiny and interference. Tracing the rulemaking process from when an agency first begins working on a rule to when it completes that regulatory action, Potter shows how bureaucrats use procedures to resist interference from Congress, the President, and the courts at each stage of the process. This exercise reveals that unelected bureaucrats wield considerable influence over the direction of public policy in the United States.</p></p><p><b>Rachel Augustine Potter</b> is assistant professor of politics at the University of Virginia. From 2005 to 2007, she worked as a desk officer at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the White House clearinghouse for agency regulations.&nbsp; She holds a PhD in public policy and political science from the University of Michigan."Potter's impressive book is a very readable description of how agency officials behave strategically in the policymaking process. It explains how unelected government officials cleverly navigate the political environment to write policies affecting the lives of virtually all Americans."&nbsp; - David Eric Lewis, Vanderbilt University<br><br><i>Bending the Rules </i>provides a compelling challenge to the long-standing wisdom that procedural mechanisms are utilized by political institutions to ensure that administrative agencies make decisions consistent with democratic preferences. Rather, Potter provides a persuasive argument and corroborative evidence demonstrating that government agencies are highly effective at employing procedural mechanisms not only to avert control by political institutions and organized interests, but also to obtain policy that is consistent with their own expertise and values. This book is a must-read for anyone with an interest in understanding how government policy decisions are made by public agencies. - George Krause, University of Georgia</p><h2>Looseleaf for From Slavery to Freedom</h2><p><p>From Slavery to Freedom remains the most revered, respected, and honored text on the market.

The kit consists of Darling's basic Molecular Vision kit with a few additional pieces, so that p orbitals could be shown in molecules like acetylene. This customized kit also has pieces that allow linear geometry for the sigma bonds of alkynes while also having orthogonal connections at each atom for the associated p orbitals. By attaching balls of the right colors it is possible to show the lobes of the p orbitals that make up the pi bonds in an alkyne. Ball colors can be matched symmetrically to show in-phase orbital overlap, or antisymmetrically to show an antibonding state. Use of colored balls with the appropriate framework geometry is a very nice feature of the Darling model set.

But behind the facade of his success was a dark secret -- at every step of the way he was building the foundation for a cocaine empire that would grow to generate over $60 million in annual sales. Award-winning journalist Mark Bowden tells the saga of Lavin&#39;s rise and fall with the gripping, novelistic narrative style that won him international acclaim as the author of the New York Times best-seller Black Hawk Down. &#34;Immensely readable . . . eye-popping . . . a smoothly crafted, exciting, can&#39;t-put-it-down book.&#34; -- Louisville New Voice</p><p>A most unlikely drug kingpin, Dr. Larry Lavin was a Philadelphia dentist at the time of his arrest and subsequent sentencing to a 42-year prison term. But Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Bowden has done an exceptional job of showing how family background and the yuppie culture of the '70s and '80s combined to produce one of the East Coast's biggest cocaine dealers. The son of a man who had once been well-to-do but continued to try to maintain an upper-class lifestyle on a lower-middle-class income, Lavin was a brilliant scholarship student at Phillips Exeter, but was expelled for drug use. Accepted to the University of Pennsylvania, he became the biggest marijuana dealer on campus, at a time when more than half the students, Bowden estimates, were using pot. Then came cocaine and profits ranging into the millions, with an organization that involved dozens of people. Eventually, however, Lavin's flamboyant spending led authorities to suspect him. A notable, in-depth look at a figure who, even after his apprehension, was able to rationalize his criminality on the grounds that he was only supplying a demand. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Trap Lines North</h2><p>Winter was near, and with Big Lindsay laid up, it looked as if the Vanderbecks were in for a hard time. Winter way up north in the Thunder Bay District of Ontario is a serious matter. It is long and bitter and there is much work to be done that requires experience and woods wisdom and courage. This winter it was up to eighteen-year-old Jim Vanderbeck and his younger brother Lindsay to take their father&#39;s place on the trap-lines. Upon their efforts, pitted against real dangers and hardships, depended the annual catch of fur and the income of the family. Jim felt the responsibility but he also felt the adventure of being all on his own. Trap-Lines North is the story of that winter. So realistically does Stephen Meader retell it that the reader is virtually taken into the woods with Jim in the fall. He tramps from line camp to line camp, followed by the staunch old sled dogs, Bruno and Pat. He sleeps in rough pole lean-tos, eats moose meat, catches fish through the ice, and from time to time feels a chill along his spine when he comes upon the tracks of the lone gray killer---the biggest wolf in Canada. Jim Vanderbeck is a real person. Based on actual diaries kept by this young woodsman, written by a master storyteller, the book presents a true picture of life in the northern wilderness that will thrill the heart of any boy who has heard the call of the great woods.</p><p></p><h2>MURDER OF A LOVER a gripping crime mystery full of twists (DI Hillary Greene)</h2><p>Looking for a <b>brilliant best-selling murder mystery</b> with a feisty female detective?<br><br><b>DETECTIVE HILLARY GREENE IS SOLVING THE COLD CASES NO ONE ELSE COULD CRACK.</b><br><br>PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A REVISED EDITION OF A BOOK FIRST PUBLISHED AS &#x201c;A NARROW MARGIN OF ERROR.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Ten years ago, Rowan Thompson was found stabbed to death with a pair of scissors in his student house.</b> It turns out that Rowan was quite a lover, with many disgruntled partners left in his wake. <br><br>But did any of them have a strong enough motive to murder him?<br><br>Meanwhile. <b>Hillary&#x2019;s stalker is getting more aggressive</b> with his messages and flowers.

It&#39;s 1942, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Manami and her family are Japanese American, which means that the government says they must leave their home by the sea and join other Japanese Americans at a prison camp in the desert. Manami is sad to go, but even worse is that they are going to have to give her and her grandfather&#39;s dog, Yujiin, to a neighbor to take care of. Manami decides to sneak Yujiin under her coat and gets as far as the mainland before she is caught and forced to abandon Yujiin. She and her grandfather are devastated, but Manami clings to the hope that somehow Yujiin will find his way to the camp and make her family whole again. It isn&#39;t until she finds a way to let go of her guilt that Manami can reclaim the piece of herself that she left behind and accept all that has happened to her family.</p><p><b>Lois Sepahban</b> lives in Herrodsburg, Kentucky, where she writes children's nonfiction books for the school library market. <i>Paper Wishes</i> is her first novel.

Filled with gorgeous color reproductions and packed with fascinating information, this beautiful book presents a chronological sampling of the world&#x2019;s important artistic styles. Double-page spreads provide a detailed description of each movement, representative illustrations, and a timeline that places the artwork in its historical context. All of these elements are presented in a playful, eye-catching manner that will appeal to a wide range of young readers. The book also features numerous ideas for projects that kids can undertake themselves and offers helpful suggestions for learning more about each style. Children will find hours of fun reading that will equip them with essential knowledge&#x2015;enhancing and deepening their understanding of art history and inspiring them in their own artistic endeavors.</p><p>TBCGr 6 Up&#x2014;Educators and art-loving parents would agree with this book's title, though kids themselves might feel differently. The rare child who voluntarily peruses this work would learn as much by visiting a good art museum. Basic facts about each movement, which include Romanesque, impressionism, surrealism, cubism, and pop art, are offered in very brief, mostly double-spread chapters containing excellent color reproductions of representative works. However, there isn't enough information here for report writers. Entries begin with helpful features, such as fact boxes containing salient information on when these movements began and ended and subjects and characteristics of the artwork. Also useful are time lines that include artists who flourished during each period and historical, literary, and artistic events that occurred concurrently. Occasional "Good to Know" sidebars provide additional facts. Pointless "Crafts Ideas" and "Quizzes" are haphazardly distributed throughout, as are suggestions for further reading that do not include full bibliographic information. Oddly, in a book targeted to children, c. ("circa") and AD are not defined. Finger also neglects to identify the word medieval as referring to the Middle Ages and uses it interchangeably with Romanesque. The otherwise informative captions accompanying the reproductions rarely indicate the countries in which the owning museums are located, and some typos and misspellings add to the flaws. This title might find an audience in larger public library collections or in schools with art history units, but where budgets are limited, pass on this one.&#x2014;Carol Goldman, Queens Library, NY</p><h2>By Grace Alone: How the Grace of God Amazes Me</h2><p><p>Are you truly amazed by God&#x2019;s grace? Or have you grown accustomed to it? Yes, we sing of God&#x2019;s &#x201c;Amazing Grace,&#x201d; but do you truly understand what you as a Christian have experienced in receiving the grace of God? Or do you take divine grace for granted?</p><p>In <i>By Grace Alone: How the Grace of God Amazes Me</i>, Dr. Sinclair B. Ferguson laments that &#x201c;we have lost the joy and energy that is experienced when grace seems truly &#x2018;amazing.&#x2019;&#x201d; In an effort to restore the wonder of divine grace, he reflects on it from seven angles, each built around a stanza from a rich but little&#x2013;known hymn, &#x201c;O How the Grace of God Amazes Me,&#x201d; written by Emmanuel T. Sibomana, a pastor in the African nation of Burundi.</p><p>This book poses probing questions for today&#x2019;s believer: &#x201c;If I am not amazed by God&#x2019;s grace, can I really be living in it?

First, there is the pulsing heart of an obscure African pastor, Emmanuel T. Sibomana, who, many years ago, penned the magnificent seven-stanza hymn &#x2018;O How the Grace of God Amazes Me.&#x2019; Then there is the grateful and responsive heart of well-known pastor-theologian Sinclair Ferguson, who has taken the seven dazzling facets of the African hymn and held them up to the manifold light of God&#x2019;s Word so that they further grace and enlighten our souls. <i>By Grace Alone</i> is a book that will fire your heart.&#x201d;</p> (Dr. R. Kent Hughes)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Rich in biblical exposition and in theological depth, <i>By Grace Alone</i> is a series of great messages by one of today&#x2019;s greatest preachers on some of the greatest Scripture texts&#x2014;all on one of the greatest themes of the Bible: <i>amazing grace!</i> This book will excite your mind, stir your affection, convict your soul, win your heart, and move you to action. It will evangelize, disciple, and mature all kinds of readers.

You run in a unique style, tailored to maximize the way you are built and how you move most comfortably.&nbsp;<br>If this is true, why do many of us struggle on the run? We watch great athletes and marvel at how comfortably they move: effortlessly, perfectly balanced, barely seeming to touch the ground as they glide by. We want to run that way, but often feel that we're painfully pounding the ground and pulling our reluctant bodies along by sweat and will.<br><br>Are some runners simply gifted with good mechanics? Did they learn how to run that way from a good coach? Is it all about the shoes?<br><br>During my 15 years as editor of&nbsp;<i>Running Times</i>, I heard every possible theory on how to run better. I watched fads come and go, listened to each new expert tout their method as the best and only way to run, and followed each trend in shoes that promised to solve all of our problems. Three years ago, when minimalism and the barefoot craze collapsed on its own promises as runners failed to adapt and continued to get injured, I felt like runners were left uncertain amid a confusing mess of conflicting voices.&nbsp;<br><br>I wanted to discover if there was anything that experts agreed upon, anything that we know for certain about how to run. Over the course of two years, I interviewed many of the world's top coaches, biomechanical researchers, physicians, and physical therapists. I learned that what they agree upon is not a specific running style but a few optimal running mechanics that often get compromised by our daily habits.<br><br>When you were young, you could run around a playground all day, effortlessly. If you had grown up in rural Kenya, where you walked and ran for transportation and spent much of your days playing and working outside, you'd likely still run that easily and comfortably. Unfortunately, from the time you were four or five years old, you started sitting in a chair eight or more hours a day. As you got older, you spent more time sitting during work and leisure, so that now your hips are almost constantly in a folded-forward position. You added hours hunched over computers and phones that pulled your shoulders and arms forward.<br><br>These lifestyle constraints have compromised your flexibility, strength, balance, and movement patterns. Your body is still trying to become an efficient running machine--but is using parts that don't all work like they are supposed to. The experts agree: No amount of form cues, trying to land on a different part of your foot, or new shoes will enable you to run the way you were born to run without addressing the underlying issue of how you've carried your body the last several years.&nbsp;<br><br>Experts also agree: there are no secrets that will instantly transform how you run. Regaining your natural running form requires integrating stretches, exercises, drills, and new posture and movement patterns into your training and lifestyle. You won't be alone in adopting these activities. The gracefully flowing runners at the front of the pack work on their mechanics every day--it is what gives them their beautiful strides, which you can have as well.<br><br>Here's the good news: Restoring your best stride will come naturally once you've corrected the imbalances created by a modern, mostly-sedentary lifestyle. It's not about changing your stride to match a one-size-fits-all ideal. In fact, trying to make changes without correcting your mechanics usually ends up making things worse, as many have found out. You need to restore your full range of motion, then break out of habitual ruts to allow your body to once again find your optimal, personalized stride.<br><br>In <i>Your Best Stride</i>,&nbsp;I describe in more detail what I found in my search for common ground regarding running form and present the steps that can help every runner restore his or her most comfortable and efficient running pattern. I've also included ideas on how to integrate the necessary work into daily life to ensure it gets done despite busy schedules--even 5 to 10 minutes a day can make a big difference over time. And I've added advice on the role of shoes and how to choose them.&nbsp;<br><br>I hope&nbsp;<i>Your Best Stride&nbsp;</i>will help you enjoy your running more as you run easier, farther, faster, and with fewer injuries.<br><br>Run Tall,&nbsp;Jonathan Beverly<b>Jonathan Beverly</b> was the editor in chief of <i>Running Times</i> magazine from 2000-2015.

After everything she has done for her family, her youngest son seeks to recover the lost treasure, traveling through terrible weather and rocky terrain. <br><br> Great for ages 5 and up.

To learn more, visit her website at&nbsp;<b>marileeheyer.com.</b>Grade 3 Up The Chinese legend of "The Chuang Brocade" is faithfully retold in a volume of exquisite beauty. The story is of a widow who supports her three sons by selling her finely crafted brocades. At the market one day she trades her work for a painting of a lovely palace. Obsessed with the beauty of the scene, she spends three full years copying the painting in a brocade, only to have it snatched away by a wind upon its completion. As she lies grieving, her youngest son, after the two elder ones succumb to greed, searches for the brocade in a quest that leads through fire and ice to a fairy palace on a mountain top. Heyer's 15 illustrations show a masterful artistic technique. From the silken threads of the sumptuous brocade to the tiniest wrinkles in a hand, the photographic realism of a silver necklace, the touchable softness of a fur cuff, the intricate perfection of an Oriental pattern and the fine hairs of a butterfly's wings, each painting offers an experience of sensuous delight. Small red woodcut-like squares featuring animals and birds from the paintings (meant to resemble chops) are placed on each white page of text, adding to the book's attractiveness. Heyer's skillful retelling of the ancient legend and her magnificent illustrations combine to form a book of astonishing beauty.

Since the 1980&#39;s Bill has had many ideas on how to improve the accuracy of the 22 rimfire, some ideas have increased the accuracy potential tremendously and some ideas proved out to be learning experiences for future ideas. Since about 2001 Bill has tried to capture his ideas, experiments, testing, and conclusions by writing about them. He has written about the successes that increased accuracy as well as the ideas that didn&#39;t improve accuracy. Although Bill is not a writer, he felt compelled to pass along the knowledge that he has obtained in the spirit of improving the accuracy of the 22 rimfire benchrest guns for everyone that has like goals. He has shared his writings previously with the benchrest community through different avenues. In this book, all of Bill&#39;s writings are assembled in a chronological order to show the evolution of the accuracy of the 22rf as he has experienced it. He goes into detail about each aspect of rimfire accuracy discussing all of the components and their contribution to the improved accuracy. This book is a must have for everyone that is serious about increasing the accuracy in their 22 rimfire guns.</p><p>William "Bill" Stewart Calfee was born September 1944 about half way between Hindman &amp; Hazard, KY. His family relocated to New Albany, IN during 1953. The Calfee family didn't have much but, they had plenty of love to smooth out the rough times. Bill spent his youth in New Albany doing research along the Ohio River as most young boys love to do. He loved to spend his free time enjoying Mother Nature to her fullest. As a young lad Bill would scan various mail-order catalogs using a flashlight under his bed covers while dreaming about owning guns. Of course, he was supposed to be sleeping. Sleeping or dreaming about guns . . . that was a no brainer for Bill . . . he could sleep another time. Bill enjoyed the mechanics of things and how they worked so much that he always had to dis-assemble items to see why they worked the way they did. This "Have to know why" spirit carried over into his love of guns. Bill was fortunate to be growing up during a time that allowed competing high school rimfire rifle teams. Bill was a member of his New Albany high school's rimfire team. This time sparked his interest into accurate rifles and what causes them to be accurate. Unknowing to him at the time, his future path was coming into focus. Back in the early 70's Bill had a terrible accident while driving his employers' utility truck. He had multiple fractures of his left leg and hip, a broken right hand and some internal injuries. This accident played a large part in him devoting more time to his gunsmithing interest due to the prolonged time needed for his recovery. His interest in guns helped him through this trying and difficult time. Bill had this desire to understand and make accurate rifles. The biggest obstacle to reaching his goal was that he didn't know how to operate a metal lathe or mill. He met this challenge by reading all he could about them and putting his hands to the controls.</p><h2>Door J&#39;Adore: A celebration of the world&#39;s most beautiful doors</h2><p>There are billions of doors around the world and, just like people, each and every one is different.<br><br>Doors are a barrier between reality and imagination, and the portal between private and public.

After Reconstruction, lynchings exhibited and embodied links between violent collective action, American civic identity, and the making of the nation.</p><p>Ersula J. Ore investigates lynching as a racialized practice of civic engagement, in effect an argument against black inclusion within the changing nation. Ore scrutinizes the civic roots of lynching, the relationship between lynching and white constitutionalism, and contemporary manifestations of lynching discourse and logic today. From the 1880s onward, lynchings, she finds, manifested a violent form of symbolic action that called a national public into existence, denoted citizenship, and upheld political community.</p><p>Grounded in Ida B. Wells&#x2019;s summation of lynching as a social contract among whites to maintain a racial order, at its core, Ore&#x2019;s book speaks to racialized violence as a mode of civic engagement. Since violence enacts an argument about citizenship, Ore construes lynching and its expressions as part and parcel of America&#x2019;s rhetorical tradition and political legacy.</p><p>Drawing upon newspapers, official records, and memoirs, as well as critical race theory, Ore outlines the connections between what was said and written, the material practices of lynching in the past, and the forms these rhetorics and practices assume now. In doing so, she demonstrates how lynching functioned as a strategy interwoven with the formation of America&#x2019;s national identity and with the nation&#x2019;s need to continually restrict and redefine that identity. In addition, Ore ties black resistance to lynching, the acclaimed exhibit <i>Without Sanctuary</i>, recent police brutality, effigies of Barack Obama, and the killing of Trayvon Martin.</p></p><p>A rhetorical framework to comprehend antiblack violence today within racialized citizenship since Reconstruction<br><br>To date, scholars of lynching studies have not examined the rhetorics through which lynching asserted citizenship identity and civic belonging. Understanding this aspect of lynching provides new insight both into lynching&#x2019;s (rhetorical) functions and into the ways lynching reverberates in the present as a constitutive feature of white civic belonging. This aspect also underscores lynching&#x2019;s performance as a form of state-sanctioned racial violence. I&#x2019;ve not yet read a work that so carefully outlines the ways lynching and its rhetorics were/are interwoven both with the formation of America&#x2019;s national identity and with the nation&#x2019;s need to continually renew that identity. (Scott Gage, assistant professor of English and director of first-year composition at Texas A&amp;M University&#x2013;San Antonio)<br><br>Fecund, provocative, and contemporarily resonant, <i>Lynching</i> makes at least three significant contributions: One, in addition to its cultural studies, political science, black studies, and historical lens, it reads lynching through a rhetorical method/analysis. Two, this approach allows the author to revitalize and repurpose heretofore both well-known, previously quoted material as well as less cited archival material/content to different effect and affect. As a result, tethering the primal terrain of literal lynching to Emmett Till, Trayvon Martin, and former President Barack Obama makes the lynching trope contemporarily relevant. Three, and maybe most significantly, Ore makes clear that lynching was not excessive or incidental to state power, but rather that lynching was/is &#x2018;organic to civil society&#x2019; reflecting the racial order of things. <i>Lynching </i>is a provocative, trenchant, very relevant rhetorical analysis of the ongoing force of the lynching trope. Because it is both historically anchored and currently relevant, <i>Lynching</i> may evoke a sense of significance for an extended period of time. (Vorris L.

Leon and Ursula are teenagers living alone in a mansion after the death of their wealthy parents. Well, not entirely alone. They are joined by Pin, the full-sized, translucent medical dummy with which their physician father amused patients by throwing his voice. (This is the point where, if you&#x2019;re the nervous type, you slowly back away from the book.) As children, Leon and Ursula treated Pin as a confidant, though now that they&#x2019;re older, it&#x2019;s only Leon who holds entire two-sided conversations with him while Ursula plays along. It&#x2019;s a bizarre stasis indeed, but everybody is happy&#x2014;until the day Ursula brings home a boyfriend who has a damning diagnosis of Leon: &#x201c;He&#x2019;s as loony as can be.&#x201d; With the family trio threatened, Leon and Pin hatch a plan&#x2014;it involves hypodermic needles&#x2014;to rid themselves of this new bother. Yes, it&#x2019;s a heck of a plot synopsis, though it can&#x2019;t convey Leon&#x2019;s calm, aristocratic first-person narration, nor does it touch upon the queasy, incestual relationship that turns the siblings&#x2019; every interaction into the kind of barely hidden perversity V.

It is always connected to a deep and invisible process of finding meaning in life through work.<br><br>In Thomas Moore&#x2019;s groundbreaking book <i>Care of the Soul</i>, he wrote of &#x201c;the great malady of the twentieth century...the loss of soul.&#x201d; That bestselling work taught readers ways to cultivate depth, genuineness, and soulfulness in their everyday lives, and became a beloved classic. Now, in <i>A Life&#x2019;s Work</i>, Moore turns to an aspect of our lives that looms large in our self-regard, an aspect by which we may even define ourselves&#x2014;our work. The workplace, Moore knows, is a laboratory where matters of soul are worked out. <i>A Life&#x2019;s Work</i> is about finding the right job, yes, and it is also about uncovering and becoming the person you were meant to be.<br><br>Moore reveals the quest to find a life&#x2019;s work in all its depth and mystery. All jobs, large and small, long-term and temporary, he writes, contribute to your life&#x2019;s work. A particular job may be important because of the emotional rewards it offers or for the money. But beneath the surface, your labors are shaping your destiny for better or worse. If you ignore the deeper issues, you may not know the nature of your calling, and if you don&#x2019;t do work that connects with your deep soul, you may always be dissatisfied, not only in your choice of work but in all other areas of life. Moore explores the often difficult process&#x2014;the obstacles, blocks, and hardships of our own making&#x2014;that we go through on our way to discovering our purpose, and reveals the joy that is our reward. He teaches us patience, models the necessary powers of reflection, and gives us the courage to keep going.<br><br><i>A Life&#x2019;s Work</i> is a beautiful rumination, realistic and poignant, and a comforting and exhilarating guide to one of life&#x2019;s biggest dilemmas and one of its greatest opportunities.</p><p>Thomas Moore is the author of <i>Care of the Soul,</i> which spent forty-six weeks on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list, and fifteen other books on deepening spirituality and cultivating the soul in every aspect of life. He has been a monk, a musician, a university professor, and a psychotherapist, and today he lectures widely on holistic medicine, spirituality, psychotherapy, and ecology. He also writes fiction and music and often works with his wife, artist and yoga instructor Joan Hanley. He writes regular columns for <i>Resurgence</i>, <i>Spirituality &amp; Health</i>, and Beliefnet.com. He has two children and lives in New England.Chapter OneGETTING NOWHERE<i>Pain penetrates me drop by drop. </i>SapphoI have a friend where I live in New Hampshire who is constantly depressed and frustrated because he can&#x2019;t find the right work. He is one of the most gifted men I know: He&#x2019;s intelligent, has a great sense of humor, loves people and is loved by them, and is an excellent artist. But he can&#x2019;t hold down a job and doesn&#x2019;t know what to do with his life. He hates the torturous rhythm of finding a new career, quitting, and trying again. With a ready smile for the outside world, he&#x2019;s like the classic clown who beneath his happy face paint is desperately sad.Many men and women are like my friend Scottie. They look relatively happy and get along on the surface of life, but deep down they despair of ever really feeling good about the work they do or believing that their lives have been worth living. They also know too well that unhappiness at work spills over into other areas of life. The failure to find the right job or to enjoy the one you have creates a special kind of depression. A person may feel that her spirit has been crushed or perhaps never brought to the light of day. Some wonder why they feel so low and never connect their depression to work. In therapy they may be talking about marital difficulties or an addiction, and they are surprised when their counselor asks about their work. It seems they haven&#x2019;t thought much about work in relation to their emotions and the things that give meaning to their lives.An opus is the lifelong process of getting life together and becoming a real person, and it is no coincidence that the word is also used for a musical composition or an artist&#x2019;s total production. You are also a work of art&#x2014;alchemists referred to the opus as the Art. You are the artistic designer of your own life, and it is the most important work you will ever do. You will produce things that will make you proud&#x2014;happy children, a good home, a well&#x2013;functioning society, and maybe even some decent art. You will become a unique person. Nothing is more beautiful or more valuable. But if that potential goes unrealized, you may despair about life in general. C. G. Jung once wrote that creativity is an instinct, not an optional gift granted to a lucky few. If you don&#x2019;t find a way to be creative in life, that instinct goes repressed and frustrated. You feel its loss as a deflation, the spirit leaking out of your sense of self. You feel empty, disengaged, and unfulfilled.The opus doesn&#x2019;t come into existence fully formed. It takes sweat and tears to go through the arduous process of finding yourself, establishing a good career, and making a life. It is especially difficult to achieve all this in a world that doesn&#x2019;t support such a deep, long&#x2013;term process. Most people don&#x2019;t think beyond the immediate need for money and a bearable job, and most companies don&#x2019;t worry much about the personal calling of their workers.Today we may not fully appreciate the workplace as a laboratory where matters of soul are worked out. We tend to focus on literal concerns such as pay, product, and advancement, whereas developments in your work life deeply affect your sense of meaning. Doing what you love and having relationships at work that help you as a person can give you feelings of peace and satisfaction at home and in the family.A recent study of how Americans feel about their work lives concluded that today people are generally happier with their jobs than they were thirty years ago, but they see their work as having a negative impact on life at home. Specifically, they are working longer hours and therefore have less time for their families, their health, and their hobbies. Modern technologies, such as e&#x2013;mail, blur the borders between work and home. Companies are also offering less in benefits and encouraging employees to work harder for profit sharing and stock ownership. The link between fulfillment at work and happiness at home is more important than ever.My friend Scottie is a case in point. When I first got to know him, I saw a vibrant man full of talent. I envied him then and still do whenever I see him relaxed and congenial or showing our circle of friends his latest canvas. His talent and personality are extraordinary. I heard about his difficulties with work but thought that all he needed was to search around and find a business that recognized what an asset he would be to them. Naively I wrote a letter of reference for him, thinking that I might solve his problem at one stroke. At that time I looked at the surface of his life; today I&#x2019;d look deeper.As time passed, I learned that he had other serious problems, that his family life, so serene on the outside, was apparently troubled and always on the edge of collapse. I was surprised to hear that he had trouble with alcohol dependency and that his occasional outbursts of rage made him feared at home and threatened his marriage. In social settings people are drawn to him like a magnet, but his private life is tragic.Scottie is having serious trouble finding the right job, staying with the job he has been able to secure, and finding pleasure and fulfillment in what he does. And I mean serious trouble. He stands a good chance of losing an extraordinary partner in his gifted wife and three unusually creative and promising children.Whatever the source of his problems may be, Scottie&#x2019;s troubled soul is focused now on his inability to find his life&#x2019;s work. He secures jobs that offer money and some satisfaction, but he still feels that he is in the wrong place. He gets so frustrated and angry that he distances himself from his family and his friends. He doesn&#x2019;t let anyone help him, and he can&#x2019;t seem to get to the root of his problem.Scottie is like many people who try to solve the problem of work at a purely practical level: getting new training, trying new careers, and judging success by the size of the paycheck. In fact, the process of finding a job, doing the work, and dealing with the relationships at the workplace has deep roots in family, personal experience, and personality issues. To get to the bottom of serious frustration, you have to consider the whole picture: the past, as well as the present; your family&#x2019;s worldview and experience with work; and the personal issues you bring to the job.In the ordinary job hunt you may be doing career testing and interviewing and experimenting with jobs, but to move toward your life work you have to work through the past, deep and raw emotions, and relationships that need attention. The roots of career problems run deep, and only a deep solution is effective in the long run.If you have anything in common with Scottie, I would recommend stopping to look closely at the whole of your life. You will find in this book a long list of things to consider in the inventory of your life experience. Think of every aspect of your life as connected, and always go deeper than you think you need to go.<b>Stalled: The Feeling of Getting Nowhere</b>Frustration with work can take many forms. One complaint I frequently hear is the feeling of getting nowhere. Rose, the mother of one of my daughter&#x2019;s friends, has had an excellent education and comes across as an able and creative person. She has ability, intelligence, and a bright personality but still can&#x2019;t move ahead with her career. She tries one job after another, but they seem to be lateral moves. She isn&#x2019;t moving closer to where she wants to be. She feels stalled, stuck, and sometimes even as if she's moving backward.These days one often hears a plea, expressed with humor or sadness, from men and women, old and young: &#x201c;What am I going to do with my life?&#x201d;or &#x201c;What am I going to be when I grow up?&#x201d;People in their fifties and sixties say this, meaning that they still don&#x2019;t know for sure who they are and what they are called to do. I have heard Rose say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m supposed to do with my life. All I know is that this isn&#x2019;t it.&#x201d;&#x201c;What am I going to be when I grow up?&#x201d;It&#x2019;s a telling remark, suggesting strongly that the person feels that she is still at the beginning of her life, perhaps even a child, immature, not having progressed as far as she should have. The laughter that accompanies the confession covers over concern and anxiety about the situation. &#x201c;Will I ever grow up? Will I ever succeed?&#x201d;If I had such a person in therapy, I&#x2019;d want to explore the background of this important self&#x2013;image. Does it play a role in other parts of life? Does it have roots in the family and in early experience? Dealing with the issue outside of the specific work situation might help resolve both the deep emotional problem and the search for a life work.My friend Scottie has apparently built up a pile of rage as well as depression over the years, knowing that he is capable of doing great things but never able to get a project off the ground. This gap between ambition and achievement can be painful to behold. He is getting nowhere, not by sitting around doing nothing, but by trying again and again without lasting success to do something valuable and worthwhile.Scottie is angry at himself for being a failure, but he directs his rage against his family. They are close at hand and will keep his secrets&#x2014;his alcoholism, his anger, and his failures. &#x201c;Disgruntled&#x201d; workers notoriously aim their aggression at the people around them; the same is true in a more subtle way in families. The frustration of not having life in gear and not doing the right job transmutes into judgment and rage and, finally, aggression. The feeling of getting nowhere is serious business.Many people believe that you should always be getting somewhere, that you should always be on the &#x201c;up&#x201d; escalator, moving forward in life. But many are not moving anywhere, especially not up. They may feel stuck in a job that feels inferior to them, far beneath their standards and expectations. They may never have found a position even close to their dreams and hopes. Their friends may worry, seeing a person doing work far from his abilities and vision.People at the top of the ladder can also feel stalled. They have had all the success they dreamed about, and still they feel unfulfilled. I have met many people like this: to all appearances wealthy and successful. They should be happy, but they&#x2019;re not. In many cases it's fairly clear that material rewards simply have not given these &#x201c;lucky&#x201d; people the deep satisfaction they crave. Late in the game they may discover that they chose the wrong path or refused an opportunity that would have given them less money but more happiness.Sometimes people get so discouraged by their failure to find adequate work that they turn against themselves and go looking for a job that has no challenge for them, pays them little, and offers no future. They punish themselves for not succeeding by ensuring that they won&#x2019;t succeed. At one point in his flailing around, Scottie did this: He took a starting position in an automobile dealership though he had no interest in it or talent for the work.It&#x2019;s clear to me now that Scottie&#x2019;s failure at work has deep roots, perhaps in his past, certainly in his emotions and relationships. When problems with work tie in with other emotional issues like marriage, family, and mood swings, it&#x2019;s clear that the only way to deal effectively with work is to face what Zorba the Greek called &#x201c;the whole catastrophe.&#x201d;<b>Dealing with the World</b>Our own disillusionment isn&#x2019;t the only source of pain and depression with regard to work. The world is out there judging us, expecting things of us, demanding that we do things in their way and not ours. Frustration with work often comes from outside as well as inside. People get moralistic about work. They tell you that you should make good money, use your talents, get more education, have objectives and goals, and stick to a plan. By these standards, most creative people throughout history appear misguided. They have lived their lives by serendipity, inspiration, and experiment.You may believe that you have tried too many different things or that you&#x2019;re too old to find a real life&#x2019;s work or that you don't have the talent or the calling to do anything significant. People may have judged you so harshly that you lost confidence in yourself. In your pain, you may have turned to alcohol, drugs, or some other numbing distraction, and those addictions in turn cause you to fail at your work. It takes a well&#x2013;grounded ego to withstand the assaults of well&#x2013;intentioned and not&#x2013;so&#x2013;well&#x2013;intentioned critics. But people who are unsure of themselves at work by definition don&#x2019;t have a strong ego. They are vulnerable to attack. They fall over easily when pushed. People in power may have gone through similar trials and now unconsciously force their underlings to remain equally unhappy.To deal with such pressures, you have to be loyal to your essence or to the person you know you can be. People around you look for evidence of success, but you may have to trust the qualities in you that you know have not yet been revealed. Otherwise you may collapse and have your spirit crushed by criticism and expectations that are not your own.Many creative people who have contributed much to the human race were not instant leaders and achievers. It took time for them to ripen into the outstanding figures we know them to be. An unexpected source of insight into this matter is the rock musician Sting. He is not only a fine musician but an excellent writer as well, as demonstrated in his penetrating and beautifully honest autobiography, <i>Broken Music</i>. There he tells of his early days trying to support himself and find his way. He worked outdoors on building sites as a laborer and then as a bus conductor and eventually as a civil servant. Later, he became a teacher in an elementary school. It was from there that he took a risk and became a professional musician.Just try to imagine Sting taking your ticket on a bus. What if he stamped your fare and said to you, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what to do with my life. I don&#x2019;t want to be doing this job when I&#x2019;m an old man.&#x201d;Knowing where Sting ended up, with wealth and fame, the question is quite a tease. How did he get from one place to the other? Remember, he didn&#x2019;t know that he was going to become Sting. He might have spent the rest of his life as a bus conductor, which might not have been a disaster, but he wouldn&#x2019;t have found an outlet for his unbounded creativity.</p><h2>The Art and Craft of Leather: Leatherworking tools and techniques explained in detail</h2><p>Creating handsome leather products is an enjoyable and rewarding hobby, but it&#39;s a craft that requires training and specialized tools.

These populist nationalists seek direct charismatic connection to 'the people', who are usually defined in narrow identity terms that offer an irresistible call to an in-group and exclude large parts of the population as a whole.</p><p><i>Identity</i> is an urgent and necessary book: a sharp warning that unless we forge a universal understanding of human dignity, we will doom ourselves to continual conflict.</p></p><p></p><h2>Wake a Sleeping Tiger (A Novel of the Breeds)</h2><p><b>When readers of dark romance and unbridled desire want to be satisfied, they turn to #1 New York Times bestselling author Lora Leigh and her &#x201c;powerful and highly erotic&#x201d; (Fresh Fiction) Breed novels.

Logic and training snapped in and she forced herself to move into position slowly.<br><br> Horror. Terror.<br><br> Those distant, primal warnings of evil were pushed quickly to the back of her mind as the child stumbled forward.<br><br> Oh God, she had to get just a little bit closer. If this wasn't timed just right, if Chelsea didn't calculate everything perfectly, then she knew that baby wouldn't be the only one who died in this lonely desert tonight.<br><br> Night vision glasses allowed her to pick up even the most minute detail in the deepening night. The sight of huge bite marks over the child's body would live in Chelsea's nightmares. If she survived. Deep, jaggedly torn flesh still seeped blood, spilling more down the already bloodstained little body.<br><br> Long, tangled black hair fell to the child's shoulders and covered the side of her heavily bruised and swollen face. She was weak, far too cold and suffering blood loss definitely, possibly hypothermal shock. If she didn't get that child out of there fast, then she was going to die.<br><br> Come here, baby. I'm right here. Come on, let me take you to your momma . . .<br><br> The plea was soundless, no doubt useless, but still, she urged the child to the edge of the rising tower of rock that hid her presence from the Coyote soldiers.<br><br> She didn't dare show herself. If they saw her, then she'd never have time to get the baby into the Desert Runner she'd taken out that night on patrol.<br><br> She was in the middle of a nightmare she couldn't have imagined. Even her deepest, darkest fears didn't hold anything this horrific.<br><br> Demonic yips and howls filled the night with terrifying sounds. They were merely tormenting the little baby, keeping her little heart beating fast and hard, her blood seeping steadily from her wounds.<br><br> So much evil. The creatures pushing the child through the night were hellish. Only hell could conceive monsters such as the ones trailing after the child.<br><br> Right here, baby. Come on, Louisa, you're almost safe. Let's go find Momma . . . She kept her eyes on the child, willing her to come to her, to sense her waiting in the shadows, ready to scoop her up and race her away from this nightmare.<br><br> "Momma, help me." The night carried the hoarse, dazed little voice clearly to where Chelsea hid. "Momma, help me." Over and over the ragged plea filled Chelsea's soul with agony and threatened to pierce the layer of ice covering her emotions.<br><br> If she let the fear free now, then she'd lose her mind, Chelsea knew. There would be no way to function, to think.<br><br> She took her eyes off the child only long enough to check the distance between the enemy and the little girl stumbling through the dark.<br><br> The Coyote soldiers were keeping Louisa in sight. If Chelsea just waited, remained out of their field of vision, then she'd have Louisa and be gone before they could get close enough to stop her. Then it would just be a matter of staying ahead of them until she got to safety.<br><br> She'd glimpsed their Runner, but she knew hers would be lighter, the motor modified to get an edge on the ones being used by the soldiers. The Breed Underground modified their vehicles for speed rather than defense or heavy weapons. Still, the Coyotes' Runner would be hard to get away from without a good head start.<br><br> It wouldn't be easy.<br><br> Watching the little girl, Chelsea gritted her teeth and made herself wait. Just a little more.<br><br> That's it, Louisa. Come this way. I'm right here, baby.<br><br> "Momma. Help me, Momma." The little voice was so weak, the night so cold, and time was running out.<br><br> Holding the blanket she carried ready, Chelsea kept a wary eye on the Coyotes and waited, still, silent. The body-warming technology of the covering would hopefully keep the little girl warm enough and protect her from further chill as they raced through the cold night; the open design of the Runner would do little to stave off the chill.<br><br> The Coyotes paused, yips and laughter filling the desert as Louisa headed straight for Chelsea, her dazed eyes staring unseeing into Chelsea through the darkness of night.<br><br> She could do this. Louisa was almost in place. Just a little closer.<br><br> The kids' parents were about thirty minutes away, their desert estate well armed as they waited for word of their daughter. Search efforts were being concentrated in the opposite direction; the report of Coyote soldiers closer to Window Rock had drawn searchers there.<br><br> It was that odd piece of information Chelsea had collected the day before that placed these creatures closer to Pinon and already had her in the area when the report went out. She was turning around and heading toward Window Rock when she'd heard the Coyotes.<br><br> The child stumbled to her knees and Chelsea felt her breath catch. She was so close.<br><br> "Come to me, Louisa," she whispered, a breath of sound she prayed the Coyotes didn't catch.<br><br> Louisa made it to her feet, jerky, uncoordinated, but she made it to the edge of the rock.<br><br> Chelsea moved.<br><br> Snapping forward, she wrapped the dark blanket around Louisa's slight body, lifted her into her arms and ran the ten feet to the Runner she'd left on standby. Before she could jump into the Runner, the night went silent. Totally, completely silent. There was no time to secure the little girl into the opposite seat now.<br><br> No time.<br><br> It had just run out.<br><br> As she latched the restraining harness around both of them, the feel of Louisa shuddering and the sound of her gasping breaths filled Chelsea with dread.<br><br> Enraged howls filled the night as Chelsea slammed the Runner into gear and the desert vehicle shot forward. The deep tread of the tires bit into dirt, sand and gravel, then all but picked up and flew through the night.<br><br> Thirty minutes.<br><br> Thirty minutes to the Cerves estate, and she was on her own until she got there. The radio had gone out, refusing to work, but there was also a chance the Coyotes' Runner was equipped with a jammer. And she wasn't far enough away from them for her radio to work yet.<br><br> The Runner's back cameras and radar were working great, though. Good enough to see that those bastards were gaining on her.<br><br> She should have never come out alone.<br><br> Under no circumstances.<br><br> She should have called in backup when she first heard the Coyotes' howls. But her cousin Linc was manning communications and he would have ordered her back.<br><br> She'd already been in the area when she picked up the radio transmissions earlier that night that the Cerveses' young daughter had been taken from the compound by suspected Council Breeds.<br><br> How the Coyotes managed that, she couldn't imagine.<br><br> Checking radar and cameras again, she calculated the distance to the compound and saw a glimmer of hope. She was actually closer than she'd thought she'd be. Not much farther.<br><br> Not that she would be exactly safe once she arrived at their compound-if she arrived. The Cerves family had brutal reputations. The Cerves criminal cartel didn't wait to ask questions. They killed first.<br><br> As she checked the monitor again, her jaw tightened. Shifting gears with fierce, quick movements, she heard power build in the motor as she pushed it for more speed, gritting her teeth and restraining a curse as the first bullet struck the side of the Runner.<br><br> The desert vehicle wasn't bullet resistant and the Coyotes knew it.<br><br> Fire flashed in the cameras and the sound of automatic gunfire behind her, pelting over the Runner, had her using every trick she knew to push the motor harder, faster.<br><br> Gunfire still erupted behind her, but the pinging had stopped. She estimated she was staying just out of reach of them. But she and little Louisa weren't home free yet, and she was running straight into an armed force that would already be prepared to shoot at the first sign of a threat. A Runner crashing the gates would definitely be seen as a sign.<br><br> The night sped by as adrenaline pumped fast and hard through her body and the Runner raced through the desert.<br><br> She had to keep both hands on the steering wheel. At the speeds she was pushing the Runner to, she didn't dare take one off to comfort the baby.<br><br> Louisa was only eight years old, though, and Chelsea knew that comfort was something the child could have used.<br><br> Eight years old.<br><br> If she survived, would her young mind ever pull free of what had happened tonight?<br><br> Twenty minutes.<br><br> She'd been racing through the night for twenty minutes.<br><br> The temperature gauge on the Runner was edging higher. It wasn't meant to run this hard, this fast, for this distance.<br><br> She was close, though. Any minute she should see the glow of the lights that lit the estate like a damned airport runway.<br><br> Guards had surrounded it earlier in the day before Louisa's disappearance. Surely they were still there.<br><br> What if they weren't?<br><br> What if the estate was deserted?<br><br> As she flew over the next rise, those lights glowed in the distance. Rather than pulling back, the Coyotes were firing again, and another ping to the side of the Runner had Chelsea quickly twisting the wheel, fighting to keep the Coyotes behind her. The chance of a bullet hitting her was slighter there. There was no protection to the side.<br><br> As she drew closer to the estate, she could see men running, automatic weapons in their hands. The gates weren't opening and there was no time to stop. If she stopped, her side would be exposed as the Coyotes raced past her. She'd be easy to pick off.<br><br> Praying the reinforced metal of the Runner's front guard held up, she pointed the Runner toward the gates, her teeth locked tight, her eyes narrowing on that point. If she could just make it to those gates and crash through . . .<br><br> As long as the Cerves guards didn't shoot her first.<br><br> She prayed they glimpsed the Breed Underground insignia she hurried to flip on. The bright red BU on the front guard was all she'd have to alert them that she wasn't some dumbass just hoping to break through and cause murder and mayhem.<br><br> No, she was bringing the murder and mayhem.<br><br> "Hang on, baby," she screamed above the sound of the Runner's motor.<br><br> Louisa's arms and legs tightened around her, but not by much. Chelsea could feel the dampness of her night suit from the little girl's blood and the child's cold flesh.<br><br> "Momma's waiting for you, baby."<br><br> She prayed that Samara Cerves-the Blood Queen, she was called-was waiting for the little girl who still whimpered for her, and that the savagery she was reported to have wasn't something her child knew.<br><br> Chances were slim, though.<br><br> Still, the Cerves compound was the little girl's only hope. And God help the family if anything happened to Chelsea because her own family wouldn't play nice.<br><br> Automatic weapons were turned on her as a dozen or more soldiers and security personnel braced to fire on her. Faces brutally hard, determined . . . murderous.<br><br> Her life flashed before her eyes and one image held in her mind.<br><br> "Cullen." She whispered his name as the gates loomed, coming closer, faster. "I'm sorry . . ."<br><br> Metal hit metal, the Runner reducing speed with a force that had the safety seat and harness reacting with the same speed to hold them in place. The collision rippled around the powerful vehicle, the frame taking the brunt of the force, the seat reacting to the still-strong shock wave that hit the interior.<br><br> Automatic gunfire ruptured the night as the gates were pushed open, and the Runner came to a stop several feet inside the interior of the compound.<br><br> Chelsea was confident the child hadn't sustained further injuries, though for some reason, her own arm was burning like hell.<br><br> "Wait! Wait!" she screamed, fighting the hard hands that reached in, tore at the harness and tried to jerk her from the seat. "Louisa. I have Louisa."<br><br> She scrambled to release the restraint, trying to be gentle, to hold the child securely as she whimpered, crying for her momma.<br><br> "I have her," she cried out, suddenly staring down the barrel of a gun, eyes wide, the certainty of death filling her mind. "I have Louisa."<br><br> Hands shaking, she let the blanket fall back, her eyes lifting to the cold, stark blue gaze of the Blood Queen herself. In those crystal-hard eyes Chelsea saw a mother's torment and a killer's need for blood.<br><br> "Momma." Weak, fear and terror worn, the little girl was suddenly trying to struggle against Chelsea, ragged nails dragging against the shoulder of Chelsea's black top.<br><br> Frantic, hysterical desperation filled the child now; those wide, dazed eyes flickering with horror would forever be seared into Chelsea's memories.<br><br> The gun barrel jerked back and the woman was reaching for the girl, screaming for the doctor, and in Samara Cerves's face Chelsea saw such misery, such pale, terror-filled pain, that she had no doubt little Louisa was safe now.<br><br> The question was, was Chelsea safe?<br><br> "Move." She was hauled out of the Runner with a suddenness she found shocking.<br><br> The hands that jerked her from the vehicle were rough and bruising as she was dropped to her feet, then dragged through the courtyard toward the side of the mansion. Stumbling, she had only a moment to glimpse the chaotic activity of soldiers and security personnel rushing behind the woman known as the Blood Queen and the blood-soaked body she cradled in her arms.<br><br> "Where are you taking me?" Desperation sliced through her as they disappeared around the side of the house.<br><br> She couldn't die here.<br><br> Struggling against the powerful grip, she tried to dig her heels into the dirt and loose stones beneath her feet, only to risk falling and being dragged along the ground.<br><br> Furious cries were falling from her lips, the need to escape frantic when he suddenly stopped, all but throwing her against the side of the house, his hand pressing over her mouth and his face only inches from hers.<br><br> Green eyes flecked with amber rioting through the irises. Rage burned in his gaze, in his expression, along with steely, uncontrolled demand.</p><h2>Understanding and Clarifying Your Values (Assessment Included)</h2><p>Bill Blackwood and Ray Mauser use their years of experience as executive coaches and consultants to help you define and clarify your personal values in this book. The authors present a discussion and definition of values as well as a tested, proven values clarification exercise. Values are those things that really matter to each of us&#x2014;the ideas and beliefs we hold as special and will defend. Ray and Bill maintain a set of values are personal to you; no two people will necessarily have identical values. Thus, it is important that you clarify your personal set of values because your values define who you are, what you stand for, and influence your individual behavior. They provide a list of 70 values to start working with. Moreover, values drive how you gather and interpret information, frame decisions, and make choices, say the authors. Gaining an understanding of your value orientation is this book&#x2019;s intention. The assessment instrument included in this book is designed to help identify those values that are most important and meaningful to you. This book goes beyond clarifying your personal values. It provides the reader with exercises and techniques for validating and testing your values. You will recognize the various ways in which you engage your values in your daily life and work processes. Also, you will learn to see how you engage in value-driven actions, which may appear neutral or simply logical but nonetheless carry out your values in the way you make judgments, choices, and decisions. The authors separate and define many terms often defined as values. They provide examples of behaviors, attitudes, attributes, traits, and related terms often viewed or misconstrued as values. They also present a discussion of other classifications of values such as core values, social, political, professional, and so forth to help you distinguish these terms from your personal values. This book is a relatively short, quick read; yet hard-hitting with a practical style. While it is designed for understanding and clarifying your personal values, it is also suitable as a handbook for clarifying values in group settings, such as seminars, workshops, classrooms, and professional development venues.</p><p></p><h2>Waking Up to This Day: Seeing the Beauty Right Before Us</h2><p>Inspiring insights on being awake and aware, in good times and bad, by the author of The Gift of the Red Bird.<br>Centuries ago, Brother Lawrence wrote the spiritual classic Practice in the Presence of God.

During the recording process, Jimi Hendrix at last had time and creative freedom to pursue the sounds he was looking for. In this remarkable and entertaining book, John Perry gets to the heart of Hendrix&#39;s unique talent - guiding the reader through each song on the album, writing vividly about Hendrix&#39;s live performances, and talking to several of Hendrix&#39;s peers and contemporaries.</p><p>Natural wit, sharpness of ear and a pervasive sense of fun prevented Hendrix from sticking just to the wah-wah pedal&#39;s literal use (and it&#39;s worth remembering that Hendrix off-stage was a natural mimic, whose imitations of Little Richard or of Harlem drag-queens made his friends howl). In fact, he found a use for the pedal without even using guitar. By turning his amp up high and treading the pedal he found he could modulate the natural hiss of amplifier valves, producing sounds of gentle breezes, howling storms or the susurration of waves on a beach; sounds that are all over &#34;1983&#34; and &#34;Moon Turn The Tides&#34;. Hendrix had an ear and (though it&#39;s often overlooked) he also had a fine, sly sense of humour that - with characteristic lightness of touch - he was able to express in music.<p>John Perry played guitar in the band The Only Ones. He is also the author of the acclaimed book about The Who, Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy.</p></p><h2>The Six-Day Hero</h2><p><p>Motti knows that war is coming. Israel is only nineteen years old&#x2015;the same age as Motti's brave older brother, Gideon&#x2015;and the tiny country is surrounded by enemies. It's only a matter of time before Egypt, Jordan and Syria attack. Motti wishes he could join the Israeli army like Gideon and be a hero. But when his best friend's family flees the country and his brother goes off to fight, Motti realizes this war isn't a game. His family is in danger, and Israel's very survival is at stake. <br> <br> But hope comes to Motti in unexpected forms. In the kind Ethiopian priest who lives nearby. In his grouchy neighbor, old Mrs. Friedburg. In the young Germans who come to offer help. In his father's childhood friend, a Jordanian man who harbors none of the hate Motti expects. Even in a scrappy stray cat that roams the bombed city without fear. <br> <br> Motti knows his older brother is a hero&#x2015;but through the six days of the war that will decide Israel's fate, he discovers other heroes in surprising places. He may even be a hero himself.</p></p><p><p><strong>Tammar Stein</strong> is the award-winning author of four young adult novels including<em> Light Years</em>, which was named a Sydney Taylor Notable Book of Jewish Content and an ALA Best Book for Young Adults. She is a graduate of the University of Virginia with a degree in English Literature. She has lived on three continents, in four countries and five states. She lives in Virginia with her family.</p><p>"The opening scene in <em>The Six-Day Hero </em>takes place at a ceremony in celebration of Israel&#x2019;s nineteenth birthday. Twelve-year-old Motti&#x2019;s brother Gideon is on the dais being honored as an Independence Day baby. Motti can&#x2019;t stand the boring, hot ceremony and wriggles out to get a drink. The story continues in that vein, presenting the early days of the state of Israel through the eyes of a typical twelve-year-old. On the cusp of what we now know as the Six-Day War, the young country is ever vigilant of the enemies surrounding it and the role that every citizen and resident must play in defending their country. <br> <br> Motti both idolizes and resents his older brother, a strapping young soldier who comes home from the army base on the weekends. On one occasion Motti gets to visit the base and surreptitiously sees more than he should, giving the viewer a look at the young country on high alert, preparing for an imminent attack. During the actual attack the author depicts how parents, teachers, students, and the elderly respond and feel, bringing the reader close to the confusion and raw feelings of the time. <br> <br> The Six-Day Hero does not shy away from showing the realities of war &#x2015; there is graphic violence, and some beloved family members do not survive. Depictions of the sorrow that follows are vivid and affecting. But the story ends on a hopeful note as Motti&#x2019;s family explores parts of Jerusalem long cut off to them and are able to see Motti's father&#x2019;s childhood home, reconnecting with old neighbors and renewing longtime friendships."&#x2015;<em>Jewish Book Council </em></p> (<i>Website</i>)<br><br><p>"The Six-Day War, told from the point of view of an Israeli seventh-grader in 1967.Motti lives in Jerusalem in a country that's only 19 years old&#x2015;just like his older brother, born on Israel's first day of independence. Pale-eyed, freckled Motti identifies as one of the 'native Israeli Sabras,' born in Jerusalem like his father, though his mother's Yiddish-inflected Hebrew implies an Eastern European origin. His Jerusalem neighborhood is populated by Jews from Hungary, Germany, Iraq, and Iran. The neighborhood even features Ethiopian monks. Indeed, all that's lacking is Muslims, as 19 years ago the Jews and Muslims of Jerusalem fled to the sectors defined by their new national border. As the governments of Israel and her neighbors jockey for position, Motti's father and older brother are called up for active duty. Soon war begins, and Motti huddles in air raid shelters; it's a claustrophobic week for an energetic boy, even given that it's one of the world's shortest wars. All the anger against Israel in Motti's world emanates from disembodied armies and governments; the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem welcome the conquering Israelis like friendly neighbors: 'smiling shyly' and waving; the Palestinian childhood friend of Motti's father even serves mint tea and cookies. Occasionally, narrator Motti's voice slips entirely into a textbook-style description of the war.

With <i>In a French Kitchen</i>, Loomis&#x2014;an expat who long ago traded her American grocery store for a bustling French farmer&#x2019;s market&#x2014;demystifies in lively prose the seemingly effortless je ne sais quoi behind a simple French meal. French cooks have the savoir faire to get out of a low-ingredient bind. They are deeply knowledgeable about seasonal produce and what m�lange of simple ingredients will bring out the best of their garden or local market. They are perfectly at ease with cracked bowls and little counter space.<br><i><br>In a French Kitchen </i>proves that delicious, decadent meals aren&#x2019;t complicated. Loomis takes lessons from busy, everyday people and offers tricks and recipes to create a meal more focused on quality ingredients and time at the table than on time in the kitchen.</p><p><b>Susan Herrmann Loomis</b> is a France-based, award-winning journalist, an author and cooking school proprietor with nine books to her credit, and a professionally trained chef. Among her books are <i>On Rue Tatin</i>, a narrative about her life in France, with recipes, which won the IACP Award for Best Literary Food Writing for 2002. Loomis contributes to many publications, including <i>Cooking Light</i>, <i>Metropolitan Home</i>, <i>France Today</i>, and <i>Gastronomica</i>. She has lived in France for nearly twenty years and operates On Rue Tatin, a cultural and culinary cooking program, from her fifteenth-century home in Louviers, France, where she lives with her two children.The French love Food.<br><br> I know, that&#x2019;s like saying &#x201c;The sky is blue.&#x201d; But the French love of food isn&#x2019;t just carnal. The French love of food is primordial. They love food the way we love our Grand Canyon, our freedom, and our waves of grain&#x2014;primitively, instinctively, fundamentally. Their love for food is overwhelmingly universal&#x2014;it permeates the air, the life, the lifestyle, and the habits of all in this country.<br><br>This love of food resonated from the day I set foot in France and smelled butter in the air. It was a chilly day in March, and I had just arrived on an early flight. nothing was open in Paris that morning, and I walked to stay warm, inhaling that buttery smell that would balloon into intensity each time I passed a boulangerie.<br><br>When one finally opened its doors, I stepped inside and bought my&nbsp;first French croissant. It shattered all over me when I bit into it, and&nbsp;I&#x2019;ve never been the same since.&nbsp;This buttery, shattery moment led me to a French life. There was, of course, a lot more involved. But that croissant was like a perfect first kiss at the start of a lifelong romance.<br><br> Since then, I&#x2019;ve discovered just how much the French love food, which has allowed me to openly love it, too. I always loved it, which made me something of an <i>extra-terrestre </i>when I was in college and after. Then, friends and colleagues greeted my love of cooking with skepticism and friendly derision, as if to say, &#x201c;Who on earth would want to spend time cooking?&#x201d; The minute I came to France I was surrounded by like minds, and my somewhat suppressed passion came fully out of the closet.<br><br>Fast-forward to a life in France raising children, writing books, teaching cooking classes, settling myself into a culture where food is the linchpin, the gathering point, the warmth in a cold world of politics, social upheaval, complex religious persuasions, and every- thing else that composes our contemporary French world. Here, I&#x2019;m surrounded by people who love food.<br><br>Take Edith, my friend and cohort in many an exploit for thirty years. She is the antithesis of the stay-at-home mom, though that&#x2019;s what she&#x2019;s been for nearly thirty years. The thing is, she coddles no one, believes that a harsh life is better than a soft one, wears Birkenstock sandals every day of the year regardless of the temperature, and is always dressed in items of designer clothing that she assembles with the flair of a diva. As for her four kids, they were born, they were fed, they were schooled, and now they&#x2019;re out of the house, all of them strong individuals with passions of their own.<br><br>What did Edith do with her time? She painted, landscapes and portraits that enchant everyone who sees them. She has many&nbsp;other passions&#x2014;remodeling, sewing, hunting down bargains on eBay. One of her most notable passions is her love of eating. I&#x2019;ve never encountered anyone who approaches meals with so much gusto. When she sits down in front of something she loves, you&#x2019;d better be sure to serve yourself quickly because otherwise she is likely to eat it all, with big, appreciative mouthfuls, down to the last crumb.<br><br>I see a lot of Edith. For one thing, I often swim in the pool she and her husband, Bernard, thoughtfully put in their backyard. If she isn&#x2019;t making lunch when I arrive, she&#x2019;s about to sit and eat it, and it&#x2019;s always a hot meal. Lately it&#x2019;s been boiled potatoes with mustardy vinaigrette and smoked herring (it&#x2019;s herring season). But it might as easily be thick, herb-rich potage, or pasta with lots of garlic and a shower of Comt�, or a mass of vegetables that she pulled from her garden and braised with bay leaf and thyme.<br><br>Edith wouldn&#x2019;t dream of eating something she considered less than scrumptious, which for her is heavily weighted to vegetables, garlic, and olive oil. Her refrigerator is mostly empty, but half their property is given over to a vegetable garden where her neighbor, Mr. Harel, has tended the same few crops for at least fifteen years. There are leeks and carrots, lettuces and potatoes, onions, green beans, and a big row of red currants. It never varies (which would drive me crazy because I like variety, but which suits Edith just fine). As long as she has these fresh staples, her life&#x2014;and her diet&#x2014; are complete.<br><br>What I find fascinating about Edith, aside from her colorful nature, is the time she spends cooking. She has absolutely no passion for it, yet her intense passion for eating drives her into the kitchen twice a day.&nbsp;She&#x2019;s efficient there like she&#x2019;s efficient everywhere. Nothing she cooks takes long&#x2014;leeks are washed and cut in seconds, then set to braise in olive oil and garlic; potatoes are put on to boil; cheese comes out of the fridge. Edith loves good bread and while she might not take time to go to the market for vegetables, she&#x2019;ll drive miles for a great loaf. She loves dessert and whips up a chestnut and honey cake in five minutes, or a thick chocolate sauce, which she&#x2019;ll pour over homemade ice cream, or a fruit tart made from the figs off her prolific tree.<br><br> Her meals are all impromptu and very simple, whether she&#x2019;s cooking for herself at noon on any old day or has ten people coming for dinner. For a dinner party, she&#x2019;ll just multiply that warm potato and herring salad, preceding it with nothing more than some delicious cured sausage, fresh walnuts (from her tree), and perhaps a chickpea or avocado pur�e; she might decide to splurge and grill perfect little lamb chops, which she&#x2019;ll cook in the fireplace; these she&#x2019;ll serve with buttery tender green beans or saut�ed leeks. If she doesn&#x2019;t want to eat meat she won&#x2019;t serve it and will, instead, offer an extra-ample cheese selection and call it good. Her meals are direct and no frills, like her. And because she&#x2019;s an artist, while guests might be surprised, they allow her this peccadillo.<br><br>Most of Edith&#x2019;s dishes are based on memories from her austere grandmother Juliette&#x2019;s farm, where she spent many a summer and school holiday. I swear, there isn&#x2019;t a flavor or food memory she&#x2019;s forgotten. If she&#x2019;s making braised endive, she&#x2019;ll tell the story of how her grandmother forced her, at age twelve, to sit in front of a plate of braised endive every meal for three days until she ate it. (This is a true story. Then, she hated endive; now, miraculously, she loves it.) When she bites into a butter cookie, it reminds her of those the housekeeper made with fresh top cream when she was a girl; when&nbsp;she makes chocolate sauce with water, it&#x2019;s because her aunt at the farm did it that way.<br><br> Edith wasn&#x2019;t &nbsp;surrounded by a lot of warmth and affection when she was growing up, so food became the vehicle for emotion. She is much like her grandmother, somewhat austere to those who don&#x2019;t know her. Yet eat at her table and you&#x2019;ll feel as though you&#x2019;re wrapped in a down comforter. Food, for her, is memory and warmth all wrapped up together.</p><h2>Ice &amp; Mixed Climbing: Modern Technique (Mountaineers Outdoor Expert)</h2><p><b>2004 Banff Mountain Exposition Award Winner and Silver Award Winner for Foreward Magazine's Book of the Year in Adventure and Recreation</b><br> <ul> <li>Will Gadd is an ESPN X Games and Ice World Cup winner</li> <li>Color photos throughout illustrate the climbing techniques</li> <li>Part of The Mountaineers Outdoor Expert series</li> </ul> <br> "Mixed climbing is my favorite discipline.

Peter&#x2019;s unhappy apprenticeship in law ended when he absentmindedly nibbled on and ruined an important legal document. If his family considered his failure a disgrace, to Peter it was an omen. Now he was free to pursue and perhaps capture the music that sang in his head. When he left St. Petersburg to teach in Moscow, he took the first decisive step on his colorful road to fame. But success did not come easily, and Peter learned to endure the hard pinch of poverty before the wealthy Madame von Meck became his patroness, providing him with a generous income. Always enchanted with the world of childhood and far more at ease in it than in the more demanding world of adults, Peter began to write ballets for his sister Alexandra&#x2019;s children. The Sleeping Beauty was followed by Swan Lake, and finally he created The Nutcracker Ballet, which assured his place in the hearts of children and adults alike.

It&#x2019;s through these treasured mementos that we meet the unforgettable heroine of Lee Smith&#x2019;s new novel. <br> <br> Raised in the smoldering ruin of the post&#x2013;Civil War American South, young Molly Petree, now orphaned, has no intention of wasting time on self-pity. She means to live her life to its fullest. So, when a mysterious benefactor appears out of her father&#x2019;s past to rescue her, she doesn&#x2019;t look back&#x2014;until she is an old woman and returns to the farm on Agate Hill. Spanning half a century, <i>On Agate Hill</i> tells the story of a woman who risks everything to remain true to herself. It&#x2019;s a novel of obsessive love, unexpected adventures, and luck&#x2014;both good and bad. Like a ballad of the Old South, Molly Petree&#x2019;s tale resonates with passion, humor, and drama. <br> <br> Lee Smith, a virtuoso of voice and vision, creates flesh-and-blood characters tempered with equal doses of comedy and tragedy. Like her popular and beloved novels <i>Oral History</i> and <i>Fair and Tender Ladies</i>, <i>On Agate Hill</i> is storytelling at its very best.Molly Petree, orphaned by the Civil War, is by her own definition "a spitfire and a burden. I do not care. My family is a dead family, and this is not my home, for I am a refugee girl."<br> <br> Raised in the ruins of a once prosperous plantation on Agate Hill in North Carolina, she's a refugee who has no interest in self-pity. To document her headstrong life, she collects its artifacts&#x2014;her lifelong diaries, letters, poems, songs, newspaper clippings, court records, marbles, rocks, dolls, bones (some human, some not).<br> <br> When a mysterious benefactor appears out of her father's past to rescue her, teenaged Molly Petree never looks back. Taking what she is offered, she saves herself and then risks everything to hold true to her nature and to true love. She casts aside two prosperous, well-born suitors to marry a dashing&#x2014;and philandering&#x2014;mountaineer only to be accused of his murder. The end of Molly Petree's story is as unpredictable and as passionate as her own wide-open heart.<br> <br> Spanning half a century, Lee Smith's portrait of a fiery Southern woman recalls the South from Reconstruction to the Roaring Twenties&#x2014;and, in the process, gives us Molly Petree, living and breathing, gripping the reader's arm as the story unfolds.</p><h2>Mir� Lithographs (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)</h2><p><p>"As regards my means of expression, I try my hardest to achieve the maximum of clarity, power, and plastic aggressiveness; a physical sensation to begin with, followed up by an impact on the psyche." &#x2014; Mir�<br>Mir�'s line recalls Picasso's in clarity and power; the Catalan's "plastic aggressiveness" led him, as it did his Andalusian friend, to bold, successful experiment and innovation in ceramics, sculpture and printmaking, especially lithography. The lithographic print medium suited and encouraged the artist's lifelong, often radical, obsession with stripping art to the marrow. The 40 plates reproduced here sample the pith of his lithographic production &#x2014; a series produced in 1944, full of the eerie images and droll distortion he had sought on canvas for decades.<br>"It's never easy for me to talk about my painting," wrote Mir�, "since it is always born in a state of hallucination induced by some kind of shock, objective or subjective, for which I am not personally responsible in the least." Mir� hallucinates on stone for these prints, filling them with monstrous beasts and one-eyed aliens adrift in a heaven of moons and stars and black nebulae, floating breasts and generative organs. These lithographs were executed shortly after finishing the famous "constellation" series of paintings (called by one critic "the most intricate, most elaborately developed of all Mir�'s compositions"), right around the time his mother died and he fired his first ceramics in collaboration with Artigas. Falling in a period of intense creative mingling of whimsy with the grotesque, these prints characterize an important juncture in Mir�'s career. They also enlarge the boundaries of lithographic technique as they simultaneously show Mir�, now "stripped" of his brilliant colors, to be an equal master of black-and-white.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>One Potion in the Grave (A Magic Potion Mystery)</h2><p><b><i>From the author of the Wishcraft Mysteries<br><br>Carly Bell Hartwell&#x2019;s love potions are always in demand in Hitching Post, Alabama,&nbsp;the wedding capital of the South....</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>When Katie Sue Perrywinkle walks into the Little Shop of Potions, Carly is surprised and delighted to see her old childhood friend.

That happened only when danger was near. My <i>witchy senses</i>&#x2014;labeled so by my best friend, Ainsley, when we were teenagers&#x2014;were at work.</p><p>The customer didn&#x2019;t look all that dangerous, but I&#x2019;d been fooled by people before. Lesson learned. However, I also had to keep in mind that the danger I felt might not be coming directly from her&#x2014;it could just be associated with her. My witchy senses weren&#x2019;t finely honed, so I couldn&#x2019;t tell which it was. All I knew was that this woman meant trouble to me.</p><p>Poly, one of my two cats, lumbered over to greet the customer and assess whether the elegant newcomer had any hidden treats lurking beneath the flowing designer caftan that swished dramatically around her thin body. Poly was forever starving to death, as his twenty-five pound frame could attest. Roly, my other (much lighter) cat, stayed curled up on the counter, basking in a puddle of sunshine, preferring naps to treats. The siblings&#x2019; breed was of unknown origin, but I suspected a mix of calico, white-and-gray ragdoll, and lethargy. Both were long-haired fluff balls of orange, gray, and white, their diluted coloring more pastel than bold. Besides their weight, another way to tell them apart was that Poly had more orange while Roly was mostly gray. They often came to work with me here at the Little Shop of Potions, and I adored each and every one of their lazy bones.</p><p>I wondered what this customer knew of my shop, a place that on first look appeared to be a blend of an herbalist and a bath and body boutique. On a daily basis, tourists wandered inside drawn in by the colors, curiosity, the allure of the window vignette, and the store&#x2019;s tagline written on the window: <i>Mind, Body, Heart, and Soul</i>.</p><p>Early-morning light streamed through the display window, glinting off the treasures I&#x2019;d collected over the years. The weights and measures, the apothecary scale, the mortar and pestle my grandma Adelaide used in this very store. The sunbeams also bounced off the wall of colorful potion bottles, splashing prismatic arcs across the shop.</p><p>I inhaled the various earthy smells from the fresh and dried herbs I used in my potion-making and absorbed the vibrant colors, the simple charm, and the magic in the air.</p><p>That was the most important part. The magic.</p><p>Most tourists didn&#x2019;t know that I hailed from an unusual combination of hoodoo and voodoo practitioners, and was a healer who used my inherited magic to treat what ailed. From sore throats to broken hearts, I could cure most anything&#x2014;thanks to a dose of magical lily dewdrops (Leilara tears) and the recipe book of potions left behind by my great-great-grandmother, Leila Bell.</p><p>The customer bent to scratch Poly&#x2019;s head, and he flopped onto his back to playfully paw her hand. The big flirt. He lacked basic moral principles and would do just about anything for the possibility of a treat.</p><p>Another surge of warning tingles crept up my spine and spread to my limbs. Instinctively, I latched onto the engraved silver locket that dangled from a long chain around my neck. The orb was a protective charm given to me when I was just a baby, not to defend me from others but from <i>myself</i>. Being an empath, someone who can experience another&#x2019;s physical and emotional feelings, was something else I&#x2019;d inherited from Leila. The locket engraved with two entwined lilies wasn&#x2019;t foolproof, but in most cases it blocked other people&#x2019;s emotions so I wasn&#x2019;t bombarded with everyone else&#x2019;s feelings. It was also something of a security blanket&#x2014;offering me solace and comfort when I was troubled.</p><p>Like now.</p><p>&#x201c;Feel free to browse around, and let me know if you need any help,&#x201d; I offered, though really I just wished she&#x2019;d walk out the door. I didn&#x2019;t know what had kindled my witchy senses, but those warnings were rarely wrong. If she stuck around, I had to prepare for the proverbial anvil to drop on my head.</p><p>The woman lowered her sunglasses a fraction and peered at me over the dark rim. &#x201c;Will do.&#x201d;</p><p>A flash of recognition sparked within me but didn&#x2019;t flame. I had the feeling I knew her somehow, yet I couldn&#x2019;t place her for the life of me. She certainly wasn&#x2019;t local.</p><p>&#x201c;Nice shop you have here,&#x201d; she said, her slow cadence that of a cultured Southern belle, one who&#x2019;d been raised up prim and proper.</p><p>Still alert, I said proudly, &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll do.&#x201d; I just hoped she hadn&#x2019;t heard about the murder that had taken place in the back room a couple of months ago. There were some things tourists needn&#x2019;t know. Fortunately, that case had been solved, the culprit brought to justice, my reputation restored, and life went on.</p><p>Slowly the woman stood, leaving Poly splayed out on the floor (treatless), his chubby belly the only proof needed that he was well fed. He wasn&#x2019;t that good an actor to be able to cover the pudge.</p><p>Her designer strappy gold high heels clacked on the wooden floor as she wandered over to a display of bath oils and surreptitiously glanced over her shoulder.</p><p>Although I usually only read people&#x2019;s energy to create a perfect potion, I didn&#x2019;t like waiting for that anvil&#x2014;I&#x2019;d had my fill of trouble with that murder and all, thank you kindly&#x2014;and thought it best to be proactive. I let go of my locket and let down my guard to feel what she was feeling.</p><p>I sensed no menace toward me at all, so the danger swirling around was most likely due to the same reason her anxiety level was through the roof. Her stress coursed through my veins, increasing my blood pressure as surely as it did hers.</p><p>Taking hold of my locket again, I let out a breath. If she were interested, I had some calming cures and sleeping potions that might soothe her a bit. Temporary fixes to an obviously bigger issue but helpful nonetheless.</p><p>As she continued to wander the store, browsing, touching, perusing, and generally acting suspicious, I eyed the big fancy bag on her arm and wondered if she was a shoplifter. Over the years I&#x2019;d learned that they came in all shapes, sizes, and pedigrees.</p><p>When she picked up a handmade soap, I walked over to keep a closer eye on her and said, &#x201c;The lilac is nice.&#x201d;</p><p>Sniffing a bar of honeysuckle soap, wrapped in a muslin bag and tagged with a custom label, she said, &#x201c;I prefer the honeysuckle myself. It brings back sweet memories.&#x201d;</p><p>Clear polish coated her short professionally manicured fingernails. She wore only one ring&#x2014;an enormous pink star sapphire on her right hand&#x2014;so apparently she wasn&#x2019;t in town to get hitched this weekend. Most likely she was a wedding guest. Probably the big Calhoun affair. The town was buzzing from the excitement of those nuptials. Especially my mama. She was in a full-blown tizzy because the wedding was being held at her chapel, Without a Hitch.</p><p>Mama in a tizzy was quite the dizzying experience&#x2014;one I&#x2019;d get to witness firsthand as she&#x2019;d roped me into helping her get the chapel ready this afternoon for the big to-do. My arm hadn&#x2019;t needed much twisting. It was, after all, the Calhouns, and I&#x2019;d have to be dead not to want an up-close peek at the family.</p><p>Headed by patriarch Warren (a U.S. senator who had just launched a bid for the White House) and his wife, Louisa, the rich and powerful (and somewhat corrupt) Calhoun family was Southern royalty. They were firmly rooted in politics and had recently branched into the entertainment industry via son Landry, who was a rising country music star. News of Landry&#x2019;s speedy engagement to recent college graduate and former pageant queen Gabriella &#x201c;Gabi&#x201d; Greenleigh had sent shockwaves through the whole country, hitting the front pages of every tabloid in the checkout stand. &#x201c;Little Orphan Gabi,&#x201d; as she had been called in the press, was the only child of one of the wealthiest couples in the state, both of whom had died in a tragic plane crash several years ago. Gabi&#x2019;s father, an oil executive, had been one of Warren&#x2019;s biggest supporters, and her mother had been best friends with Louisa. After their deaths, Louisa vowed to care for the girl, and took her under her wing. During this past year Landry and Gabi had fallen in love. The picture-perfect couple, America&#x2019;s newest&#x2014;and wildly popular&#x2014;sweethearts, were due to be married right here in Hitching Post in two days&#x2019; time, this Saturday.</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t go wrong with either.&#x201d; I handed the woman a small wooden basket so she could shop. Might as well make some money off this strange encounter.</p><p>Turning to face me straight on, she said, &#x201c;Carly Bell Hartwell, do you remember that one time you dared me to sneak into your aunt Marjie&#x2019;s yard, knock on her door, and run? Only I got all tangled up in her honeysuckle vines and she caught me? My rear still aches sometimes from the switching she gave me. Despite that incident I continue to love the scent of honeysuckle so don&#x2019;t be pushing your lilac wares on me.&#x201d;</p><p>In a split second the woman&#x2019;s voice shifted from high class to a local twang. I stared in shock at her and finally said, &#x201c;Hush your mouth! Katie Sue Perrywinkle? Is that truly you under all that fanciness?&#x201d;</p><p>Katie Sue whipped off her sunglasses, and familiar blue eyes danced with mischief. Throwing her arms wide, she rushed at me, wrapping me in a tight hug.</p><p>We spun in a circle, our squeals scaring Poly out of his stupor. His belly hung low to the ground as he dashed behind the counter.</p><p>&#x201c;Just look at you!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How long&#x2019;s it been?&#x201d;</p><p>Without missing a beat, she answered, &#x201c;Ten years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me everything.&#x201d; I pulled two stools over to a worktable. &#x201c;Did you get to college like you wanted? Are you a full-fledged doctor now?&#x201d;</p><p>Laughing, she glanced at her diamond-faced watch and said, &#x201c;I only have but a minute.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Talk fast, then.&#x201d; So, Katie Sue was back. I&#x2019;ll be damned.</p><p>I drank in the sight of her, trying to note the many changes. Her hair had gone from brown to blond, her skin from deeply tanned to pale cream, and her whole countenance from hillbilly to high society. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so shocked you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d; I stumbled for words. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unrecognizable. The hair, the clothes, the accent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Everything,&#x201d; she said firmly. &#x201c;It took years, too, with thousands paid to a finishing school, voice coaches, a stylist&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The list goes on. Oh, and my name&#x2019;s Kathryn Perry now. I had it legally changed right after I left town.&#x201d; Her voice dropped to a melancholy whisper. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want them to find me.&#x201d;</p><p>Them.</p><p>Her family.</p><p>My stomach twisted at the old memories. Katie Sue had what my mama would call an &#x201c;unfortunate&#x201d; childhood. Her daddy had died in prison after being sent there for killin&#x2019; a man in a bar fight. Her mama liked the hooch a little too much, and hadn&#x2019;t been above raising her hand&#x2014;or any other object in the vicinity&#x2014;to keep her three daughters, Lyla, Katie Sue, and Jamie Lynn, in line. And when she remarried? <i>Shoo-ee.</i> Her new husband had an even bigger problem with addiction and a hair-trigger temper. And after one particularly bad fight with each other, the state stepped in and awarded custody of the girls to Katie Sue&#x2019;s granddaddy, a hardworking man who lived simply and loved those girls fiercely. It was a move that had probably saved the lives of all three sisters, but eventually tore the siblings apart.</p><p>Last I heard, Katie Sue&#x2019;s mama, Dinah Perrywinkle Cobb, and her husband, Cletus Cobb, had been released from the local pen, having served two years each for cooking up drugs in their trailer near the river. They&#x2019;d been free going on five months now and had so far managed to stay out of trouble.</p><p>With wide eyes, Katie Sue glanced around the shop. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you how much I&#x2019;ve missed this place. It was more my home than that old ramshackle trailer.&#x201d;</p><p>As a young girl Katie Sue had spent hours and hours here, learning about herbal medicine at the knee of Grandma Adelaide, same as I did. Katie Sue would talk on and on about how one day she was going to become a doctor and use the knowledge Grammy had taught her to help others.</p><p>Grammy had always encouraged her lofty goals, though truthfully, I&#x2019;d never thought Katie Sue would leave. Hitching Post had a way of holding on to its own. &#x201c;Did you get your MD?&#x201d; I asked, hoping her dreams had come true. With no lack of determination or stubbornness, I imagined she wouldn&#x2019;t have given up on her goal without a knock-down, drag-out fight.</p><p>&#x201c;It surely wasn&#x2019;t easy, Carly, and I&#x2019;m still in my residency down in Birmingham, but I did it.&#x201d;</p><p>She spoke softly, the pride in her voice coming across loud and clear, though I wasn&#x2019;t the least bit surprised to hear it. Even though hers hadn&#x2019;t been an easy upbringing, she&#x2019;d always retained a sense of pride. Almost too much sometimes, not always wanting to accept help when offered. Fiercely independent, she was always determined to get things done&#x2014;her way. I figured it to be a defense mechanism, an ability to have some semblance of control in an out-of-control environment.</p><p>I squeezed her hand. &#x201c;Good on you.&#x201d;</p><p>Taking another peek at her watch, she said, &#x201c;I have to get going. I have an appointment. Can we meet up later to continue catching up? I want to hear what you&#x2019;ve been up to. Anyone special in your life?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s complicated,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>She lifted both eyebrows. &#x201c;<i>That</i> sounds like a story. Let&#x2019;s get coffee later, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you back in town to see Jamie Lynn?&#x201d; I asked, referring to Katie Sue&#x2019;s baby sister. She&#x2019;d been just ten years old when Katie Sue left. &#x201c;I heard she&#x2019;s bad sick.&#x201d;</p><p>Pain flitted across her eyes and she paled.</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t know?&#x201d; I asked, cursing the foot I just stuck in my big mouth.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>I should have realized as much. It never ceased to amaze me how money could tear a family apart. Lyla, the eldest Perrywinkle sister, had married straight out of high school and never looked back, leaving Katie Sue and Jamie Lynn to mind their granddaddy when his heart began to fail. Mostly the task fell on a teenaged Katie Sue since Jamie Lynn was so young, and she never once complained about it, though it sopped up what was left of her already pathetic childhood. After the man died, the whole town was shocked to learn that the old coot had been buying stocks and stashing away money all his years. In his will he left all his worldly goods solely to his full-time caretaker&#x2014;his granddaughter Katie Sue, who at that time had just turned twenty. She inherited almost two million dollars.</p><p>No one was more stunned than Katie Sue&#x2019;s own kin, who crawled from the woodwork without a lick of shame, their palms out. When met with a firm refusal&#x2014;Katie Sue proclaimed the only other person who deserved a share of the inheritance was Jamie...</p></p><h2>Rickety Stitch and the Gelatinous Goo Book 1: The Road to Epoli</h2><p><b><i>Nimona</i> meets <i>Adventure Time</i> as a singing skeleton searches for his origins in this full-color graphic novel series kickoff!</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Meet Rickety Stitch . . . a walking, talking, singing skeleton minstrel.

Unlike the other reanimated skeletons in this world, Rickety retains his personality, but he has no memory of who he was when he was alive, and the only key to his past is a song whose fragments come to him in a dream. So in true buddy fashion, the duo venture on an epic quest to find the plucky troubadour's origins. Drawn in stark black-and-white lines with somber gray shading, the dream sequences contrast beautifully with the lurid colors and chaotic art style of the rest of the book.

A theology of grace deals with the most basic question of how God interacts with human subjects and hence with the world. The opening chapter offers a simple statement of the theological enterprise involved in retrieving the theological symbols from our Christian past and reinterpreting them in the light of our common understanding of God and human existence today. Then in a series of historical interpretations it explores the presuppositions, questions, and responses in the classic statements of a few important Western theologians. Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Trent, and Rahner all come under examination. <p>The final chapters of the book isolate certain common themes that are consistently present in the traditional language of grace and reinterpret these in terms of the concept of liberation. Thus the author lays the foundation for a theology of liberation within a theology of grace. In doing so, he recasts the theology of grace into a social context and provides the basis both for a new language of grace and for a spirituality of participation in history and social change.</p></p><p>Roger Haight is a Jesuit priest and theologian.

Livingstone set out with a large team, on a course that would lead through unmapped, seemingly impenetrable terrain into areas populated by fearsome man-eating tribes. Within weeks his expedition began to fall apart - his entourage deserted him and Livingstone vanished without trace. He would not be heard from again for two years. While debate raged in England over whether Livingstone could be found in the unmapped wilderness of the African interior, James Gordon Bennet, a brash young American newspaper tycoon, hatched a plan to capitalise on the world&#39;s fascination with the missing legend. He commissioned his star reporter, Henry Morton Stanley (born John Rowlands in Wales!), to search for Livingstone. Stanley undertook his quest with gusto, filing reports that captivated readers and dominated the front page of the New York Herald for months. Into Africa traces the journeys of Livingstone and Stanley in alternating chapters. Livingstone&#39;s is one of trials and set-backs, that finds him alone and miles from civilisation. Stanley&#39;s is an awakening to the beauty of Africa, the grandeur of the landscape and the vivid diversity of its wildlife. It is also a journey that succeeds beyond his wildest dreams, clinching his place in history with the famous enquiry: &#39;Dr Livingstone, I presume?&#39;. In this, the first book to examine the extraordinary physical challenges, political intrigue and larger-than-life personalities of this legendary story, Martin Dugard has opened a fascinating window on the golden age of exploration that will appeal to everyone&#39;s sense of adventure.</p><p><p>With the utterance of a single line&#x2014;&#x201c;Doctor Livingstone, I presume?&#x201d;&#x2014;a remote meeting in the heart of Africa was transformed into one of the most famous encounters in exploration history. But the true story behind Dr. David Livingstone and journalist Henry Morton Stanley is one that has escaped telling. <i>Into Africa </i>is an extraordinarily researched account of a thrilling adventure&#x2014;defined by alarming foolishness, intense courage, and raw human achievement.<br>In the mid-1860s, exploration had reached a plateau. The seas and continents had been mapped, the globe circumnavigated. Yet one vexing puzzle remained unsolved: what was the source of the mighty Nile river? Aiming to settle the mystery once and for all, Great Britain called upon its legendary explorer, Dr. David Livingstone, who had spent years in Africa as a missionary. In March 1866, Livingstone steered a massive expedition into the heart of Africa. In his path lay nearly impenetrable, uncharted terrain, hostile cannibals, and deadly predators. Within weeks, the explorer had vanished without a trace. Years passed with no word.<br>While debate raged in England over whether Livingstone could be found&#x2014;or rescued&#x2014;from a place as daunting as Africa, James Gordon Bennett, Jr., the brash American newspaper tycoon, hatched a plan to capitalize on the world&#x2019;s fascination with the missing legend. He would send a young journalist, Henry Morton Stanley, into Africa to search for Livingstone. A drifter with great ambition, but little success to show for it, Stanley undertook his assignment with gusto, filing reports that would one day captivate readers and dominate the front page of the <i>New York Herald</i>. <br>Tracing the amazing journeys of Livingstone and Stanley in alternating chapters, author Martin Dugard captures with breathtaking immediacy the perils and challenges these men faced. Woven into the narrative, Dugard tells an equally compelling story of the remarkable transformation that occurred over the course of nine years, as Stanley rose in power and prominence and Livingstone found himself alone and in mortal danger. The first book to draw on modern research and to explore the combination of adventure, politics, and larger-than-life personalities involved, <i>Into Africa</i> is a riveting read.</p>&#x201c;An action-packed recounting of one of the most famous incidents in the history of exploration. Until well into the 19th century, European geography textbooks portrayed central Africa as a vast, uncharted wasteland, almost certainly a graveyard for any outsider unwise enough to enter it. . . . In the late 1860s, [David] Livingstone and a large entourage disappeared somewhere between Zanzibar and Lake Tanganyika while poking around for the source of the Nile.

After five hundred years of conquest and social destruction, he says, any useful reflection must come to terms with the political state of Indian affairs and the political hopes and visions for recovering the health and well-being of Indian communities. Does Christian theology have a positive role to play? Tinker&#39;s work offers an overview of contemporary native American culture and its perilous state. Critical of recent liberal and New Age co-opting of Native spiritual practices, Tinker also offers a critical corrective to liberation theology. He shows how Native insights into the Sacred Other and sacred space helpfully reconfigure traditional ideas of God, Jesus&#39; notion of the reign of God, and our relation to the earth. From this basis he offers novel proposals about cultural survival and identity, sustainability, and the endangered health of Native Americans.</p><p>Situating Native American religion today.George E. &#34;Tink&#34; Tinker is Professor of American Indian Cultures and Religious Traditions at Iliff School of Theology, Denver, Colorado.

Alongside the quest for the New Testament church (and congregational community), Weaver especially highlights the Baptist commitment to religious liberty and the individual conscience.

Women from all walks of life&#x2015;from household caregivers and nurses to nuns working as apothecaries&#x2015;drove the Italian medical economy. In convent pharmacies, pox hospitals, girls&#x2019; shelters, and homes, women were practitioners and purveyors of knowledge about health and healing, making significant contributions to early modern medicine.</p><p>Sharon Strocchia offers a wealth of new evidence about how illness was diagnosed and treated, whether by noblewomen living at court or poor nurses living in hospitals. She finds that women expanded on their roles as health care providers by participating in empirical work and the development of scientific knowledge. Nuns, in particular, were among the most prominent manufacturers and vendors of pharmaceutical products. Their experiments with materials and techniques added greatly to the era&#x2019;s understanding of medical care. Thanks to their excellence in medicine urban Italian women had greater access to commerce than perhaps any other women in Europe.</p><p><i>Forgotten Healers</i> provides a more accurate picture of the pursuit of health in Renaissance Italy. More broadly, by emphasizing that the frontlines of medical care are often found in the household and other spaces thought of as female, Strocchia encourages us to rethink the history of medicine.</p></p><p>Sharon T. Strocchia is Professor of History at Emory University. Her research focuses on the social and cultural history of Renaissance Italy, gender and sexuality in early modern Europe, and the history of health and medicine. She is the author of <i>Nuns and Nunneries in Renaissance Florence</i>, which won the Marraro Prize for the best book on Italian history from the American Catholic Historical Association.&#x201c;This superbly researched and elegantly written study of women&#x2019;s roles in the pursuit of health in late Renaissance Italy puts women back in the center of medical knowledge and medical practices during a major turning point in European history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Judith Brown, author of <i>Immodest Acts</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Beautifully illuminates the many ways in which women acted as medical agents and became medical artisans in Renaissance Florence and beyond. Strocchia&#x2019;s deeply researched study reveals how Medici women, controversial saintly healers, nun apothecaries, and hospital nurses in an age of syphilis all participated in a political economy of family, faith, health, and charity. Essential reading for anyone interested in gender and medicine in the early modern era.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Paula Findlen, author of <i>Possessing Nature</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Impeccably researched and highly readable, <i>Forgotten Healers</i> is the most comprehensive study of early modern women&#x2019;s involvement in medicine to date. A remarkable book with fresh perspectives that significantly advances our understanding of the distinctive ways of learning and knowing that characterized the early modern age.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sandra Cavallo, coauthor of <i>Healthy Living in Late Renaissance Italy</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Makes a vital contribution to the history of medicine, gender studies, and Renaissance studies. With plentiful excursuses throughout that reward curiosity with delightful explanations, and lucid and engaging prose, Strocchia showcases the various roles carried out by women in the provision of health care in early modern Italy.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sheila Barker, Director at the Medici Archive Project</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Forgotten Healers</i> defines medical work to include the activities of people beyond professional physicians and surgeons.

Why the hell would you do that?&#x201d;<br><br>William Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews, bristled, his face red with anger. It wasn&#x2019;t the blasphemy, Ewen knew, but the not-so-subtly implied criticism.<br><br>Erik MacSorley, the West Highland chieftain and greatest seafarer south of the land of his Viking ancestors, shot Ewen an impatient glare. &#x201c;What Lamont meant to say,&#x201d; MacSorley said, attempting to mollify the important prelate, &#x201c;is that with the English tightening their watch on the local churches, it could be dangerous for the lass.&#x201d;<br><br>Not only could MacSorley sail his way through a maelstrom of shite, he could also talk his way out of one and come out smelling like a rose. They couldn&#x2019;t have been more different in that regard. Ewen seemed to step in it wherever he walked. Not that he cared. He was a warrior. He was used to wallowing in muck.<br><br>Lamberton gave him a look to suggest that muck was exactly where he thought Ewen belonged&#x2014;preferably under his heel. The churchman addressed MacSorley, ignoring Ewen altogether. &#x201c;Sister Genna is more than capable of taking care of herself.&#x201d;<br><br>She was a woman&#x2014;and a nun at that. How in Hades did Lamberton think a sweet, docile innocent could defend herself against English knights bent on uncovering the pro-Scot &#x201c;couriers of the cloth,&#x201d; as they&#x2019;d been dubbed?<br><br>The church had provided a key communication network for the Scots through the first phase of the war, as Bruce had fought to retake his kingdom. With war on the horizon again, the English were doing their best to shut down those communication routes. Any person of the cloth&#x2014;priest, friar, or nun&#x2014;crossing the borders into Scotland had been subject to increased scrutiny by the English patrols. Even pilgrims were being harassed.<br><br>Perhaps sensing the direction of his thoughts, Lachlan MacRuairi interjected before Ewen could open his mouth and make it worse with Lamberton. &#x201c;I thought you knew we were coming?&#x201d;<br><br>The thin, nondescript bishop might look weak, especially compared to the four imposing warriors who were taking up much of the small vestry of the priory, but Lamberton had not defied the greatest king in Christendom to put Robert the Bruce on the throne without considerable strength and courage. He straightened to his full height&#x2014;a good half-foot under the shortest of the four Guardsmen (Eoin MacLean, at only a few inches over six feet)&#x2014;and looked down his long, thin nose at one of the most feared men in Scotland, as MacRuairi&#x2019;s war name of Viper attested. &#x201c;I was told to look for you at the new moon. That was over a week ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were delayed,&#x201d; MacRuairi said without further explanation.<br><br>The bishop didn&#x2019;t ask, probably assuming&#x2014;correctly&#x2014;that it had to do with a secret mission for the Highland Guard, the elite group of warriors handpicked by Bruce to form the greatest fighting force ever seen, each warrior the best of the best in his discipline of warfare. &#x201c;I could not wait any longer. It is imperative that the king receive this message as soon as possible.&#x201d;<br><br>Though they were in England, it was not Edward Plantagenet, the English king, of whom Lamberton spoke, but the Scottish one, Robert Bruce. For Lamberton&#x2019;s efforts in helping Bruce to that throne, the bishop had been imprisoned in England for two years, and then released and confined to the diocese of Durham for two more. Although recently the bishop had been permitted to travel to Scotland, he was back in England under English authority. It was where Bruce needed him. The bishop was the central source for most of the information winding its way to Scotland through the complex roadway of churches, monasteries, and convents.<br><br>&#x201c;Where did she go?&#x201d; MacLean asked, speaking for the first time.<br><br>&#x201c;Melrose Abbey by way of Kelso. She left a week ago, joining a small group of pilgrims seeking the healing powers of Whithorn Abbey. Even if the English do stop them, they will let her on her way once they hear her accent. What cause would they have to suspect an Italian nun? She is probably already on her way back by now.&#x201d;<br><br>The four members of the Highland Guard exchanged glances. If the message was as important as the bishop said, they&#x2019;d best make sure.<br><br>MacSorley, who had command of the small team for this mission, held Ewen&#x2019;s gaze. &#x201c;Find her.&#x201d;<br><br>Ewen nodded, not surprised the task had fallen to him. It was what he did best. He might not be able to sail or talk his way out of a maelstrom like MacSorley, but he could track his way through one. He could hunt almost anything or anyone. MacSorley liked to say Ewen could find a ghost in a snowstorm. One wee nun shouldn&#x2019;t give him too much trouble.<br><br>Sister Genna was used to finding trouble, so initially she wasn&#x2019;t alarmed when the four English soldiers stopped them on the outskirts of town. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time she&#x2019;d been questioned by one of the English patrols that roamed the Borders from one of the castles they occupied nearby, and she was confident of her ability to talk her way out of any difficulties.<br><br>But she hadn&#x2019;t factored in her companion. Why, oh why, had she let Sister Marguerite come along with her? She knew better than to involve someone else. Hadn&#x2019;t she learned her lesson four years ago?<br><br>But the young nun with the sickly disposition and big, dark eyes so full of loneliness at being so far from her home had penetrated Genna&#x2019;s resolve to avoid attachments. Over the past nine days on the journey from Berwick-upon-Tweed to Melrose, Genna had found herself watching over the girl who&#x2019;d just recently taken her vows, making sure she had enough to eat and that the walking wasn&#x2019;t tiring her overmuch. The girl&#x2014;at barely ten and eight, Genna couldn&#x2019;t think of her as anything else&#x2014;had already suffered one breathing spell since leaving Berwick. Sister Marguerite suffered from what the Greeks called &#x201c;asthma.&#x201d; The lung ailment had taken her from her home in Calais in a pilgrimage to seek the healing powers of St. Ninian&#x2019;s shrine at Whithorn Abbey.<br><br>But Genna&#x2019;s journey had come to an end at Melrose, and when the time had come for them to part ways this morning, she&#x2019;d found her throat growing suspiciously tight. Marguerite had looked at her with those soulful brown eyes and begged Genna to let her walk with her part of the way. And God forgive her, Genna had relented. &#x201c;Just as far as Gallows Brae,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told her, referring to the small foothill not far beyond the market cross where the church used to hang its criminals. What harm could come to the girl in the middle of the day, a stone&#x2019;s throw from the abbey?<br><br>Plenty, it seemed.<br><br>Marguerite gave a startled cry as the soldiers surrounded them, and Genna cast her a reassuring glance. It will be all right, she told her silently. Let me handle it.<br><br>Genna turned to the thickset soldier with a tinge of red in his beard, whom she took for the leader. Seated on his horse with the sun behind him, she found herself squinting at the gleam from his mail. What little she could see of his face under the steel helm and mail coif looked blunt, coarse, and none-too-friendly.<br><br>She spoke at first in Italian, with its roots in Vulgar Latin, which it was clear he didn&#x2019;t understand, and then in the heavily accented French that she used with Sister Marguerite and was more commonly understood in the area, which he did. Looking him straight in the eye and giving him her most reverent smile, she told him the truth. &#x201c;We carry no messages. We are only visitors to your country. How do you say . . . p-p,&#x201d; she feigned, looking for the right word.<br><br>He stared at her dumbly. God, the man was thick&#x2014;even for a soldier! Over the past few years she&#x2019;d run into her share. Giving up, she pointed to her pilgrim&#x2019;s staff and the copper scallop-shell badge of St. James that she wore on her cloak.<br><br>&#x201c;Pilgrims?&#x201d; he filled in helpfully.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, pilgrims!&#x201d; She beamed at him as if he were the most brilliant man in the world.<br><br>The man might be thick but he wasn&#x2019;t easily put off. His gaze sharpened first on her and then on Marguerite. Genna felt her pulse jump, not liking the way his gaze turned assessing. &#x201c;Why do you not speak, sister? What are you doing out here on the road alone?&#x201d; he asked Marguerite.<br><br>Genna tried to answer for her, but he cut her off. &#x201c;I will hear from this one myself. How can I be sure you are foreigners as you say?&#x201d; He said something in English to one of his companions, and Genna was careful not to react. She didn&#x2019;t want him to realize that she understood English. Not even Marguertite knew. &#x201c;Look at those tits,&#x201d; he said, pointing to Marguerite. &#x201c;Bet they&#x2019;re half her weight.&#x201d;<br><br>Marguerite shot her a terrified look, but Genna nodded her head in encouragement, glad for Marguerite&#x2019;s ignorance of their words. Still, Genna&#x2019;s heartbeat quickened.<br><br>&#x201c;We were saying goodbye, monsieur,&#x201d; Marguerite explained in her native French.<br><br>His eyes sparked. &#x201c;Goodbye? I thought you were on a pilgrimage?&#x201d;<br><br>Fearing what Marguerite might unintentionally reveal, Genna interrupted again. &#x201c;My destination was Melrose. Sister Marguerite seeks the healing powers of Whithorn Abbey.&#x201d;<br><br>His eyes narrowed on the young nun, taking in her thin face and pale complexion. For once, Genna was grateful that the fragile state of Marguerite&#x2019;s health was reflected in her delicate appearance.<br><br>&#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d; he asked slowly. &#x201c;I did not realize Melrose Abbey was a popular pilgrimage destination.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps not as popular as Whithorn or Iona, but popular enough for those who revere the lady,&#x201d; she said, crossing herself reverently, and he frowned. Melrose, like all Cistercian abbeys, was dedicated to the Virgin Mary.<br><br>&#x201c;And you travel by yourself? That is quite unusual.&#x201d;<br><br>Genna had had a dog like him once. Once he got hold of a bone, he wouldn&#x2019;t let it go. She just needed to find a way to get him to drop it. But first she had to make sure Marguerite was safely away. &#x201c;In my country, no. Only someone possessed by the devil would harm a bride of Christ.&#x201d; She paused innocently, letting him contemplate that. His face darkened, and she continued, &#x201c;There is a group of pilgrims we passed on their way to Dryburgh Abbey,&#x201d; which was only a few miles away. &#x201c;I hope to join them for the rest of the journey. Perhaps you will be so kind as to show me the way?&#x201d; Without waiting for him to answer, she pulled Marguerite into a hug. With any luck, Marguerite would be gone before he realized what she&#x2019;d done. &#x201c;Goodbye, Sister. Godspeed on your journey,&#x201d; she said loudly, then whispered in her ear so that only she could hear, &#x201c;Go . . . quickly . . . please.&#x201d;<br><br>The girl opened her mouth to argue, but Genna&#x2019;s hands tightened on her shoulders to stave off her protests.<br><br>Marguerite gave her a long anxious look, but she did as she was bid and started to walk away. She tried to slip through a gap between two of the horses, but the leader stopped her. &#x201c;Wait there, Sister. We have not finished our questions yet. Have we, lads?&#x201d;<br><br>The way the men looked at each other made Genna&#x2019;s pulse take an anxious leap. They were enjoying this, and it was clear that it was not the first time they&#x2019;d been in this position. Could these soldiers have something to do with the group of nuns who&#x2019;d gone missing late last year?<br><br>She looked around for help. It was the middle of the day&#x2014;mid-morning, actually. Surely someone would pass along this way soon. However, although the village was just behind them, the thick trees that shrouded the road like a leafy tunnel prevented anyone from seeing them. And even if they were seen, would anyone interfere? It would take a brave soul to stand up to four mail-clad English soldiers.<br><br>Nay, it was up to her to get them out of this. She&#x2019;d tried appealing to the leader&#x2019;s vanity and that hadn&#x2019;t worked. Nor had appealing to his honor, which appeared distinctly lacking. The man was a bully, who liked to prey on the weak and vulnerable&#x2014;which, fortunately, she was not. But he&#x2019;d shown discomfort when she reminded him of her holy status, so she would concentrate on that.<br><br>A quick glance at Marguerite made her heart sink with dread. God help them, fear was bringing on one of Marguerite&#x2019;s attacks! Though it had happened only once before, Genna recognized the telltale quick gasping of breath.<br><br>Genna didn&#x2019;t have much time. Having lost patience with the soldier&#x2019;s game, she rushed over to the girl and pulled her under her arm protectively. She murmured soothing words, trying to calm her down, all the while glaring up at the captain. &#x201c;Look what you have done. You have upset her. She is having an attack.&#x201d;<br><br>But the words seem to have no effect on the man. &#x201c;This won&#x2019;t take long,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Bring them,&#x201d; he said to his men in English, presumably so she wouldn&#x2019;t understand.<br><br>Before Genna could react, she and Marguerite were being dragged deeper into the forest, her staff lying useless in the leaves behind them. Marguerite was clutching at her frantically and let out a desperate cry when the soldiers finally managed to separate them.<br><br>Genna tried to appear calm though her heart was racing. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Sister,&#x201d; she said confidently, &#x201c;this will all be sorted out quickly. I&#x2019;m sure these good Christian men mean us no harm.&#x201d;<br><br>It was a sin to lie, but in some cases, she was certain it would be excused. Genna didn&#x2019;t need to understand the soldiers&#x2019; words to guess what they planned. But unfortunately, she understood every one of them, so she heard the chilling details.<br><br>&#x201c;The old one is prettier,&#x201d; the captain said, switching again to English to speak to his men. &#x201c;But we&#x2019;d better start with the sickly one in case she doesn&#x2019;t last.

But soon Bruce would send them running back to England.

He is the author of twenty-five books.Modern society lacks the rituals available in primitive cultures, claims Gurian, whereby a boy separates from his mother as he moves into manhood. As a result, many modern men do not adequately separate from their mothers. Gurian discusses the troubled relationships that result. He points out that the father's role in this separation is crucial; from him the boy learns what it is to be a man. If the father is absent or disengaged, the boy may be hurt. In unhappy families, mothers may give the wrong messages to their sons. In the second half of the book, Gurian offers a workbook-like exercise designed to take the reader on a journey to heal his relationship with his mother.

D'Este's masterly account comes into its own." &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i></b></p><p>Born into hardscrabble poverty in rural Kansas, the son of stern pacifists, Dwight David Eisenhower graduated from high school more likely to teach history than to make it. Casting new light on this profound evolution, Eisenhower chronicles the unlikely, dramatic rise of the supreme Allied commander.</p><p>With full access to private papers and letters, Carlo D'Este has exposed for the first time the untold myths that have surrounded Eisenhower and his family for over fifty years, and identified the complex and contradictory character behind Ike's famous grin and air of calm self-assurance.</p><p>Unlike other biographies of the general, <i>Eisenhower </i>captures the true Ike, from his youth to the pinnacle of his career and afterward.</p></p><p>There is hardly a shortage of books about Dwight Eisenhower, but Carlo D'Este's <i>Eisenhower: A Soldier's Life</i> stands tall in this forest by virtue of the author's insistence on a too-often forgotten rule of biographers: show--don't tell about--the subject. Though D'Este doesn't neglect Eisenhower's early years (his sketch of the man's rambunctious West Point years is hearteningly entertaining), the book concentrates on his military career, including his years of treading water in the Philippines. By far the most trenchant sections, however, deal with World War II (including a keen look at the little-discussed North African campaign.) We see Ike, who had a famous temper and, when angry, a most indelicate vocabulary, chain-smoking cigarettes and unable to sleep in the weeks leading to D-day; refusing--out of disgust for German atrocities--to be present at the signing of the articles of surrender; bantering, though his heart was heavy, with enlisted men; wrestling contentiously with MacArthur and Field Marshall Montgomery. We read excerpts of his letters to Mamie and are privy to, perhaps, his laying the groundwork for a political career. <i>A Soldier's Life</i>, long but brisk, sympathetic but not adoring, rigorous but never tedious, is a commendable biography. <i>--H.

After tonight, would he ever feel like one of them again? In a few days, everything was going to change, and it killed him. Since his first year at Creighton Academy, way back in the seventh grade, he&#x2019;d known his friends would be a part of every single day&#x2014;usually a big part. Since they&#x2019;d formed a friendship in prep school, the &#x201c;Perfect Gentlemen,&#x201d; so named by a sarcastic counselor, had been tight. That first Christmas, Dax had asked him what he was doing for the holidays. The conversation had ended with him accepting an invitation to spend two weeks with the Spencer family. In fact, he&#x2019;d managed to worm his way into spending every summer break or holiday with one of their families for years. He wouldn&#x2019;t be lucky enough to continue that tight-knit shit during college.</p><p>What the hell was he going to do now?</p><p>Connor looked out over the beach where his buddy Gabe Bond had started a massive bonfire. It crackled and the embers promised warmth. The moon hung low, and Connor could hear their laughter, practically smell the hot dogs they were roasting. That wouldn&#x2019;t be the only thing smoking out there, but he rarely touched anything harder than a beer. He couldn&#x2019;t. He was a scholarship kid, which meant he had to prove his worth every second of every day or he would be right back in the trailer park.</p><p>Now that they had graduated and prep school was in their rearview mirror, Connor refused to go back to that sad-sack single-wide with the cracked linoleum and broken stairs. But he also wouldn&#x2019;t be joining his buddies at Yale. Of course, they had no idea. All they knew was that he&#x2019;d gotten his acceptance letter at the same time as the rest of them.</p><p>He alone had been forced to wait for more information to see if he could actually attend. Unfortunately, his financial aid letter had not been quite as cheerful. In fact, that letter had slapped him with the reminder that no matter who his friends were, he lived in a different world. He&#x2019;d merely had a four-year reprieve from having to deal with that truth.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d; Dax Spencer clapped a hand on his shoulder. He dangled a six-pack from his other hand. &#x201c;Why are you hanging alone up here? The party is on the beach, man. Well, unless you&#x2019;re Roman, and then the party is in Gabe&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; bedroom. I am not cleaning that up. What the hell is he thinking, taking twins in there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Double the pleasure?&#x201d; Connor quipped.</p><p>Roman had actually offered him one. A beautiful blonde from their sister prep school who would likely be headed straight to Yale and pledging a sorority closely tied to Skull and Bones. Hell. That wasn&#x2019;t exactly accurate, was it? She would serve the men of Skull and Bones because they would run the world one day.</p><p>No one ran the world from community college, and they didn&#x2019;t run it from where he was going, either.</p><p>There would never have been an invite to Skull and Bones in Connor&#x2019;s future, even if he could have afforded the Yale tuition. Bonesmen came from the elite. No matter how closely he was associated to these men, Connor could never forget where he came from. Neither would anyone else.</p><p>Dax winced. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a realist, man. I think it&#x2019;s just double the trouble&#x2014;even for a night. I&#x2019;m with Scooter. I kind of wish Gabe hadn&#x2019;t sent out that invite. It&#x2019;s our first night of freedom. It would have been cool to spend it together. But hey, we&#x2019;ve got all summer for that, I guess. One last blowout before the real fun starts.&#x201d;</p><p>Like the rest of the group, Dax was headed to Yale, though after his four years, he intended to join the Navy as his father had, and his grandfather before him, and so on, dating back to when the U.S. Navy had first been formed. Gabe and his ancestors were the first family of aeronautics. The rest of the Perfect Gentlemen came from equally pedigreed backgrounds. Maddox Crawford&#x2019;s family practically owned the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Roman Calder came from a long line of powerful D.C. lawyers. Zack, aka Scooter . . . well, he was being groomed to become president of the United States.</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t wait.&#x201d; Connor simply wasn&#x2019;t ready to admit that he wouldn&#x2019;t be staying here for the summer.</p><p>&#x201c;Mad bought a brownstone off campus.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought we were supposed to move into fraternity houses.&#x201d; It was tradition among this set. Each of their fathers had pledged influential frats.</p><p>&#x201c;And live through all that hazing? Fuck that,&#x201d; Dax said with a shake of his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m with Mad on this one. We&#x2019;re our own frat, brother, and we take care of each other. Senior year at Yale, Skull and Bones will come for Zack. You know they will. And Roman&#x2019;s dad is legacy. Mad just wants them to have a place where they&#x2019;re not expected to be the next freaking saviors of the free world. He thinks it&#x2019;s up to us to keep those two grounded. Everyone else in the world is going to want a piece of Zack, and because Roman is never going to leave his side, they&#x2019;ll want a piece of him, too. So Mad wants to remind them who their real friends are.&#x201d;</p><p>Connor looked out over the dark water shimmering under the moonlight, then at the beach. Mad danced around the bonfire with total abandon.</p><p>Puck. Ever since Connor had read Shakespeare, he&#x2019;d thought of Mad as Puck&#x2014;impish and chaotic, yet truthful when a person least expected it. That brownstone was Mad&#x2019;s attempt to keep their little family together. They had four years before the world would separate and test them, each in their own way. Four last years to live together and influence one another. It was a good plan. Mad simply didn&#x2019;t know all the facts, and Connor intended to keep it that way because his pride wouldn&#x2019;t allow anything else.</p><p>&#x201c;Your dad was in,&#x201d; Connor pointed out. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a legacy as much as Roman. You should be a Bonesman, too. It would help your Naval career. You want to make admiral, right?&#x201d;</p><p>Dax shrugged. &#x201c;Yeah, but who knows?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re fuckers if they don&#x2019;t let you in,&#x201d; Connor insisted.</p><p>Dax was the best guy he&#x2019;d ever met. Shit, he would miss Dax most of all. Like freaking Dorothy and the Scarecrow.</p><p>Connor frowned. Maybe he would get a little wasted tonight. He was sounding awfully maudlin.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be honest. I don&#x2019;t want in. I don&#x2019;t want to rule the world. I just want my own command someday. And one really hot woman to settle down with. Roman&#x2019;s insane. See you down there?&#x201d; Dax was halfway down the steps, already moving away from Connor.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure. I&#x2019;ll be there in a bit.&#x201d;</p><p>Unmoving, Connor watched Dax join the others.</p><p>Creighton Academy had been the best years of his fucking life. Likely, they always would be. But after tonight, it would be time to make his own way. He would claw out of poverty while he watched the rest of them soar into their wealth and power.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking lonely there, son,&#x201d; a deep voice to his left said.</p><p>Connor turned and spotted the man standing in shadow almost immediately. He was tall, his hair just starting to thin out on top while graying at his temples. He was lean, without the usual middle-aged paunch. He wore a three-piece suit and expensive loafers, which struck Connor as odd since they were at the beach. Even the businessmen who came out here changed before they left the city.</p><p>&#x201c;What can I do for you, Officer? Or should I say Special Agent? The Bonds aren&#x2019;t here. If you&#x2019;re looking for them, you&#x2019;ll have to go back to Manhattan. Only the son and his friends are here now.&#x201d;</p><p>He quickly assessed his chances of walking into the house and finding Roman in any kind of position that wouldn&#x2019;t make Connor want to go blind. The odds were ridiculously bad. He&#x2019;d had a good twenty minutes, so his freak flag was probably flying high, but he was also known as the teenaged law god in their circle. He&#x2019;d ruthlessly used school code against their administrators on more than one occasion. If the feds were here for some reason, Roman would be the one to handle it.</p><p>The man chuckled and stepped into the light from the porch. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not with the FBI, but I find it interesting that your mind went there. Any second guesses?&#x201d;</p><p>If the man was carrying a gun, his tailor was impeccable because Connor couldn&#x2019;t detect the line of the man&#x2019;s holster under his clothes.</p><p>&#x201c;FTC?&#x201d; With really rich people, it was always a risk. The Federal Trade Commission watched over stock transactions, and he wouldn&#x2019;t put it past them to come after any of his friends&#x2019; parents. &#x201c;I would say IRS, but the shoes are too nice.&#x201d;</p><p>He recognized the Ferragamos. They were the same style Dax wore when meeting his parents for brunch. Most IRS officials couldn&#x2019;t afford thousand-dollar shoes. Mrs. Spencer had bought Connor a pair and some proper clothes when she realized all Connor had was his school uniform, some worn jeans, and a few T-shirts. After that first year, the woman had always invited him to shop for clothes with Dax. He&#x2019;d felt bad about the expense until he realized how genuinely happy she was seeing to his well-being. He was going to miss her, too.</p><p>&#x201c;Interesting observation for a boy whose mom was a trailer park whore.&#x201d;</p><p>A chill went up Connor&#x2019;s spine. &#x201c;Or maybe you&#x2019;re nothing but a sleazy reporter. I think I&#x2019;ll call the cops and let them sort it out.&#x201d;</p><p>The man put up a hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. That was harsh. And you won&#x2019;t call the cops. That&#x2019;s not incense I smell. I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;ve spent so much time in the field, I&#x2019;ve lost all conversational finesse. I&#x2019;m not a reporter. But I&#x2019;ll get to who I represent in a minute.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re here for me.&#x201d; He quickly reassessed the situation. College recruiter? For lacrosse? Any university that wanted him for their team would have contacted him long ago. He&#x2019;d attended Creighton on a lacrosse scholarship, but he hadn&#x2019;t been good enough for the Yale team. &#x201c;For the record, she wasn&#x2019;t a whore. My mother never accepted money for spreading her legs. Get it right. She was our trailer park&#x2019;s resident skank and full-time waitress at a greasy truck stop. What college do you work for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not with Yale and I suspect that would be a problem for you.&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m keeping my options open.&#x201d;</p><p>The man in the suit chuckled and leaned against the railing. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to play it that way, huh? I know about your issues. I know the scholarship Yale offered you isn&#x2019;t enough. How much would you have to borrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eighty grand.&#x201d; More if he went to grad school. And the truth was he didn&#x2019;t even know what he wanted to do.</p><p>&#x201c;Ask Crawford out there for it. He won&#x2019;t miss the money. He came into his trust this year, right? Five hundred million, if I recall. He would write you a check and never miss a penny.&#x201d; The man was starting to sound a little like Mephistopheles, whispering his devil&#x2019;s bargains.</p><p>Connor had already discarded the idea. He knew what he was going to do, what he had to do. &#x201c;Why are you so interested? Because I suspect you&#x2019;re not from a university. So what do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Universities aren&#x2019;t the only institutions who recruit young people such as yourself. I represent a group with a singular interest in finding the smartest young men and women, people who possess both brilliant minds and a certain flexibility in their moral character. I need a young man like you who loves his country enough to sacrifice for it.&#x201d;</p><p>Since when did the military send out recruiters? &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too late. I&#x2019;m scheduled to see a Navy recruiter on Monday. I&#x2019;ll be at RTC in Great Lakes the week after that.&#x201d;</p><p>He&#x2019;d picked the Navy because Dax would be there in a couple of years. Yes, he would be enlisted and Dax would be on the officer track, but he felt better knowing they would be in it together in some small way.</p><p>The man sighed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m well aware of your meeting. Might I say that would be a waste of your talents, Connor? And I also believe you&#x2019;ll end up in the same place, just years later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what place would that be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I would rather you used that brain of yours to tell me.&#x201d;</p><p>What could he be talking about? Almost none of the big law enforcement agencies recruited directly out of high school. College was another matter.</p><p>He hadn&#x2019;t had any run-ins with the law, hadn&#x2019;t gotten caught doing anything he shouldn&#x2019;t. The only thing he&#x2019;d ever done that might attract the attention of law enforcement was to send in his assessment that the terrorist groups Jamaat al-Fuqra, Gama&#x2019;a al-Islamiya, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the National Islamic Front had put aside their differences and were working together to find a soft target in the U.S. He&#x2019;d gotten involved in a group that tracked conspiracy theories. When he&#x2019;d joined, they&#x2019;d been all about the Kennedy assassination and alien cover-ups, but he&#x2019;d whipped them into shape. They were smart and had simply needed a proper outlet. They&#x2019;d combed papers and talked to people and come up with a conspiracy of their own.</p><p>He&#x2019;d sent his predictions to the CIA but never heard back. Three weeks later, the World Trade Center had been attacked, killing six and injuring a thousand after a truck bomb had been detonated under the North Tower.</p><p>&#x201c;So Langley finally read my report and figured out I was right?&#x201d;</p><p>A smile split the man&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Oh, I read your report&#x2014;after the attack, of course. You were right. What kind of high school kid follows terrorist groups?&#x201d;</p><p>A perverse one. He knew a bunch of kids who were fascinated by serial killers. He&#x2019;d always wanted to know what made a man do something crazy like strap on a bomb and walk into a crowded plaza. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a hobby.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid when we received your report, someone tossed it aside in the &#x2018;kook&#x2019; pile. After we pulled it out and dissected it, your conclusions were so spot-on that a faction within my group assumed you were involved in the attack, even though we&#x2019;d already prosecuted four of the perpetrators and were pursuing two others. They wanted to question you, but I got one of my tingles.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds like you need a shot of penicillin, buddy.&#x201d; Connor didn&#x2019;t like the feeling he was getting. Why would the CIA come out here? Why not give him a call? Why wait over a year to question him?</p><p>The man chuckled again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking about instincts not STDs, but I enjoy your sarcasm. The Navy won&#x2019;t.

Because I&#x2019;m not. I follow them. I believe they&#x2019;re beginning to get sophisticated. There&#x2019;s this new thing. The Internet. I know DARPA has had it for years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, you know that because you managed to hack into the system. You&#x2019;re the reason they&#x2019;re developing security to protect themselves. By next year, the Internet will be fully commercialized, and we need a new wave of operatives. You understand that communications is changing. The way we listen is changing, and analysis just got interesting. So you can join up and do the Navy thing for a couple of years, or you can let me pay your way to Yale. You&#x2019;ll get a degree in communications with a minor in world politics.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ivory-tower professors know nothing about real world politics,&#x201d; he said with a huff, but his brain was working overtime.</p><p>&#x201c;No, they do not, son.

Gareth Fitzallen finished reading the final drafts of a complicated business contract while the servant threw back the curtains and opened the window.</p><p>Hendrika purred, stretched, and rubbed her eyes. Gareth collected the vellum sheets he had spread over her body, the better to keep them organized. The maid plumped up an assortment of pillows. Hendrika sat up and rested her back against them, exposing her lush, naked body to the maid, to Gareth, and possibly to the family who owned the tall, narrow house across the canal.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you require anything else?&#x201d; the maid asked. Her downcast eyes still allowed a gaze that rested on Gareth&#x2019;s bare chest. She glanced up into his eyes for a second through her lashes. Her nostrils flared. The maid was becoming a problem. He did nothing to encourage her, but inevitably Hendrika would see one of the sly smiles or hot looks sent his way.</p><p>Hendrika shooed the woman away, then poured coffee into the two cups. &#x201c;What are all these documents?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The shipment to England from Honfleur. We have finalized the terms of the sale. The count&#x2019;s factor and I need only sign. And you, too, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>Although fair like many of the residents of Amsterdam, Hendrika&#x2019;s eyes could grow very dark when she became thoughtful. They turned black now. &#x201c;You are sure your brother the duke will guarantee your payment? Elbert would turn over in his grave if he knew I took this cargo from one foreign port to another on credit alone.&#x201d;</p><p>He set down his coffee on the tray, gently brushed a long lock of her curly blond hair aside, and bent to plant a distracting kiss on the full globe of her breast. &#x201c;Of all that we have shared this last month, I suspect your late husband would find our partnership in this shipment the least of it.&#x201d;</p><p>Strong fingers stretched through his hair, then held his head in place, encouraging him to distress Elbert&#x2019;s ghost all the more. She squirmed, almost upsetting the tray, and giggled in the guttural way she had. Then she pushed him away and returned to her breakfast, her breasts now heavy and hard and their tips protuberant. She buttered some bread. &#x201c;Which jam do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cherry.&#x201d;</p><p>Two newspapers had come up with the tray. She took the Dutch one and gave him the one out of Paris. He munched his bread while reading the French political news.</p><p>Suddenly a grip closed on his arm. Hendrika exclaimed something in Dutch.</p><p>&#x201c;Gareth, my love,&#x201d; she whispered after taking a deep breath. &#x201c;Look at this here. Can you read it? Should I translate?&#x201d;</p><p>He took the paper. She stroked his arm while he read the short notice she indicated. Five words in he barely noticed her there.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Zeus.&#x201d;</i> His own breath caught and held before he exhaled.</p><p>His half brother Percival, the fourth Duke of Aylesbury, was dead. He had died more than a week earlier. Suddenly. Abruptly. Unexpectedly.</p><p>&#x201c;This is shocking. He was not a sickly man. Far from it. Young still, too. Only thirty-three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is meant, the inquiry is open?&#x201d; she asked softly.</p><p>&#x201c;It is just a formality. I must go back, of course. Immediately. I need to help the others, and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. Of course,&#x201d; she cooed sympathetically.</p><p>He turned the paper&#x2019;s sheets until he found the schedule of packets from Amsterdam to London. Cutlery and china clinked while Hendrika returned to her meal. He set the paper aside on top of the stack of vellum.</p><p>&#x201c;We will need to sign these contracts today, now.&#x201d; He gestured to them. &#x201c;I will send a message to the lawyers and arrange a meeting.&#x201d;</p><p>She examined her bread while she slathered jam on it. &#x201c;With your brother dead, is that wise? His name swayed the count to extend credit to you. It swayed me too. That and other things.&#x201d;</p><p>He stretched out beside her and helped himself to a bite from her bread. &#x201c;There is now another half brother who is the duke, one who loves me even more. God forbid he drops dead as well; there is yet another in line. We never run out of them. Nothing has changed.&#x201d; He gave her a reassuring kiss.</p><p>She made the kiss a long one, then looked into his eyes. &#x201c;But you will leave now, and I do not think you will be back. So I must ensure I am paid one way or another.&#x201d;</p><p>She dipped her short, blunt knife into one of the little blue and white pots, then smeared the garnet jam around her breast. &#x201c;Cherry, I think you said you prefer this morning.&#x201d; She took the pot in one hand, and the knife in the other, and gestured for him to remove the tray. Carefully, slowly, she drew circles of jam around her other breast, dabbed two large globs on her nipples, then painted streaks down her body.</p><p>&#x201c;Here, too, I think.&#x201d; She spread her plump thighs, and painted lower yet. &#x201c;Oh, yes, and here. You must be your wicked best this morning, so I do not worry about your credit today.&#x201d;</p><p>He let her finish as she wanted. Then he braced himself above her and began licking the jam, so she would think about nothing at all for a very long time.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Eva hitched her clumsy bundle higher under her arm. A snapping breeze threatened to unveil the object shrouded in old burlap. She stopped to tuck the coarse fabric closer all around the heavily sculpted plaster frame. When she had chosen this painting, she had failed to consider how hard it would be to hide and carry it.</p><p>While she fussed with her burden, she kept one eye on a figure moving on the road. Another stranger. With nearby Birmingham&#x2019;s growth, and with all the people displaced by the failed harvests, strangers moving through the countryside hardly merited note. Yet this one raised a tiny alarm, for reasons she could not name. Maybe he moved too slowly for a man with someplace to go. In fact, it looked as if he had actually slowed so he would not pass the house&#x2019;s drive before she reached its end.</p><p>This was not the first time she found herself wondering about a stranger. Last week there had been another one, this time in town. Only she was sure she also saw him later, on the lane near her house.</p><p>She scolded herself for inventing ghosts. Her current mission made her nervous, that was all. She should not have this painting, and guilt made her overcautious.</p><p>She walked on. She glanced back at the house she had just left as she approached the point where its drive met the road. Years ago, before half the trees lining this private lane died, most likely one could not see much besides chimneys from this spot. Now the derelict condition of the building was visible to all. More a large hunting lodge than a proper manor house, it consisted of stone wings attached to a rustic Tudor core. Thirty years ago it might have been considered haphazard in design. Now the tastemakers would think it charming.</p><p>Each time she visited, more damage could be seen. Today a whole section of garden wall had vanished, its stones no doubt pilfered to build some outbuilding on one of the nicer properties of Langdon&#x2019;s End. She expected to round the bend in the road one day and discover nothing more than a heap of rock.</p><p>She turned onto the road, fussing with the stupid frame, trying not to keep looking back at the man now walking behind her. Suddenly she heard something that froze her fingers. A horse approached. From the sound of its hooves, it was galloping toward her and nearing the bend in the road ahead that would bring her into view.</p><p>She quickly examined her burden to make sure nothing showed, then walked forward with long strides, hoping she appeared to be a woman going about her day&#x2019;s perfectly honest, completely legal, not the least untoward business. In seconds a huge black horse, its head strained against its reins and its teeth bared like a stallion out of hell, bore down on her. Hooves clamoring, breath snorting, that devil head grew larger fast.</p><p>It passed that point where its rider should have slowed upon seeing someone on the road. It just kept coming. Alarmed, she jumped aside to make way, damning the rogue who had carelessly risked her life to his whim. At that the horse reared up. Its front hooves pawed the air, and the beast let out a long, furious whinny.</p><p>Cool moisture gathered around her feet and ankles. She looked down to see she had stepped right into a deep puddle. She cursed again. Her shoes would probably be ruined.</p><p>&#x201c;My sincere apologies.&#x201d; The voice came from on high while she lifted one foot to determine the damage. Soaked. Ruined for sure.</p><p>&#x201c;It is a little late for courtesy,&#x201d; she snapped. She concentrated on placing her feet in such a way as to exit the puddle without stepping in it yet again. The burden she carried did not make it any easier. She could barely see over it. Perhaps if she lifted it above her head&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;The house distracted me. I know coming upon you so fast was inexcusable, but it appeared no one was about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you had been watching the road, you would know it appeared no such way.&#x201d; She looked behind her to point to the other person on the road. Only he was gone. Perhaps he took a shortcut through the woods.</p><p>Her skirt proved too narrow for the long strides she needed. She had no choice except to slosh through the puddle to its edge.</p><p>A hand jutted in front of her face, grabbing for the painting. &#x201c;Allow me to relieve you of this so you do not drop it.&#x201d;</p><p>She smacked the hand away and made her way to dry grass.</p><p>The horse panted and quivered, probably deciding whether to take a bite out of her. She looked up its considerable flank and the long legs and handsome boots that gripped it. She looked higher, up the dashing garnet riding coat to the casually tied cravat. Finally her gaze rose to the face of the man who had addressed her.</p><p>Her fury momentarily left her. It lasted no longer than a three-count, she was sure, but in that tiny pause, not only her anger ceased. Her breath did, too, and the movement of the leaves in the breeze, and perhaps even the revolution of the earth.</p><p>The rider was beautiful. No other word would do. Handsome would be too vague a description. Attractive would be inadequate. Thick black hair, dark eyes, and eyebrows that arched perfectly, all graced features both regular and precise. The only flaw, a rather wide mouth, could hardly be called a disadvantage, seeing as how it gave the man both expressive possibilities and an undeniable sensual quality.</p><p>Then again, he did not need the mouth for that. His air and manner, the very way he sat on that horse, announced he would be nothing but trouble for a woman. Of course, most women would find him too delicious to resist. She suspected he knew that. How could he not when fools like she stared gape-mouthed upon seeing him?</p><p>Those dark eyes scrutinized her as surely as she did him, only with much more amusement than she experienced in her own study. He had probably noticed that three count. She doubted he found it a novel reaction to himself.</p><p>&#x201c;I have ruined your shoes. I insist that I pay for another pair.&#x201d;</p><p>It had been his fault and he should pay, but she reacted badly to the offer. She resented that he noticed she could ill afford the loss of the shoes. She hated that he sought to subject her to his charity.</p><p>&#x201c;The only payment I ask is that you not gallop that horse on this road while you are admiring architecture. You are too easily impressed by the latter, if that house distracted you.&#x201d;</p><p>He turned to look at the house. &#x201c;I think it handsome.&#x201d;</p><p>She rearranged her bundle in her arms. &#x201c;On the outside, perhaps it would appeal to those who favor sentimentality over sophistication. Inside it is derelict, however. No one has lived there in my memory, and its owner does not maintain it. It is a haven for vagrants and thieves, and the people of the local town would be glad if it burned down. Perhaps one day it will.&#x201d; She hoped not. That house had been very useful to her the last five years.</p><p>Hitching up her painting again, she began walking down the road. She heard the horse move. Then she felt its breath on her shoulder. She started, and almost jumped aside again.</p><p>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t you allow me to help you carry that? Or better yet, give you a ride to where you are going? It looks to be a heavy package, and those shoes must be uncomfortable now.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked back over her shoulder, up at the stunning face now marked by a winning smile. No, that mouth was no flaw. Masculine and firm, it turned him from merely beautiful to seductive. He gazed down at her warmly. Perhaps a little too warmly. That should have alarmed her anew. Instead little flutters beat inside her. It was all she could do not to blush and mew.</p><p>&#x201c;No, thank you. I will manage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You do not have to be afraid. I promise to behave myself. I am utterly harmless.&#x201d;</p><p>His expression, most amused by his own words, put the lie to his reassurance. <i>Come with me and I will show you the most wicked delights,</i> those teasing eyes promised.</p><p>&#x201c;I am not afraid of you, sir. Your horse, however, terrifies me. Could you keep back a bit more?&#x201d;</p><p>He held back, but still followed. &#x201c;Are you going to the town? It is some distance. At least a mile.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would not accept a ride with you, even if I had five miles to walk. Please, be on your way, and I will be on mine.&#x201d;</p><p>A nod of acquiescence. He turned the black beast, trotted down the lane, then halfway up the drive to the house. He then sat there looking at it. He had given up the game because something interested him more than dallying with her.</p><p>Eva looked back one more time before the bend in the road took the rider out of her view. He appeared magnificent, with the breeze blowing back his hair so his fine profile cut the sky, his gaze absorbed and pensive. If she were a good artist and not just a middling copyist, she would feature him in a grand composition full of dashing action. Instead, she painted his image on her memory.</p><p>Her ruined shoes did not bother her on the half mile to her family home. Nor did the clumsy weight of the painting. She smiled all the way.

He is a writer, observes the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, who can &#x201c;convincingly squeeze whole lives into a mere twenty pages or so.&#x201d; Now Chaon marshals his notable talents in his much-anticipated debut novel.<br><br><i>You Remind Me of Me</i> begins with a series of separate incidents: In 1977, a little boy is savagely attacked by his mother&#x2019;s pet Doberman; in 1997 another little boy disappears from his grandmother&#x2019;s backyard on a sunny summer morning; in 1966, a pregnant teenager admits herself to a maternity home, with the intention of giving her child up for adoption; in 1991, a young man drifts toward a career as a drug dealer, even as he hopes for something better. With penetrating insight and a deep devotion to his characters, Dan Chaon<i> </i>explores the secret connections that irrevocably link them. In the process he examines questions of identity, fate, and circumstance: Why do we become the people that we become? How do we end up stuck in lives that we never wanted? And can we change the course of what seems inevitable?<br><br>In language that is both unflinching and exquisite, Chaon moves deftly between the past and the present in the small-town prairie Midwest and shows us the extraordinary lives of &#x201c;ordinary&#x201d; people.</p><p><b>Dan Chaon</b> is the acclaimed author of<i> Fitting Ends </i>and <i>Among the Missing</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award, which was also listed as one of the ten best books of the year by the American Library Association, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, <i>The Boston Globe</i>, and <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, as well as being cited as a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book. Chaon&#x2019;s fiction has appeared in numerous journals and anthologies, and won both Pushcart<i> </i>and O. Henry awards. Chaon teaches at Oberlin College and lives in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, with his wife and two sons.1<br><br>March 24, 1977<br><br> Jonah was dead for a brief time before the paramedics brought him back to life. He never talks about it, but it&#x2019;s on his mind sometimes, and he finds himself thinking that maybe it&#x2019;s the central fact of the rest of his life, maybe it&#x2019;s what set his future into motion. He thinks of the fat cuckoo clock in his grandfather&#x2019;s living room, the hollow thump of weights and the dissonant guitar thrum of springs as the little door opened and the bird popped out; he thinks of his own heart, which was stopped when they got to him and then suddenly lurched forward, no one knew why, it just started again right around the time they were preparing to pronounce him deceased.<br>This was in late March 1977, in South Dakota, a few days after his sixth birthday.<br>If his memory were a movie, the camera would begin high in the air. In a movie, he thinks, you would see his grandfather&#x2019;s little house from above, you would see the yellow school bus coming to a stop at the edge of the long gravel road. Jonah had been to school that day. He had learned something, perhaps several things, and he rode home in a school bus. There were papers in his canvas knapsack, handwriting and addition and subtraction tables that the teacher had graded neatly with red ink, and a picture of an Easter egg that he&#x2019;d colored for his mother. He sat on a green vinyl seat near the front of the bus and didn&#x2019;t even notice that the bus had stopped because he was deeply interested in a hole that someone had cut in the seat with a pocketknife; he was peering into it, into the guts of the seat, which were made of metal springs and stiff white hay.<br><br>Outside it was fairly sunny, and the snow had mostly melted. The exhaust from the bus&#x2019;s muffler drifted through the flashing warning lights, and the silent bus driver lady caused the doors to fold open for him. He didn&#x2019;t like the other children on the bus, and he felt that they didn&#x2019;t like him either. He could sense their faces, staring, as he went down the bus steps and stood on the soft, muddy berm.<br><br>But in the movie you wouldn&#x2019;t see that. In the movie you would only see him emerging from the bus, a boy running with his backpack dragging through the wet gravel, a red stocking cap, a worn blue ski jacket, stones grinding together beneath his boots, a pleasantly rhythmic noise he was making. And you would be up above everything like a bird, the long gravel road that led from the mailbox to the house, the weeds along the ditches, the telephone poles, barbed-wire fences, railroad tracks. The horizon, the wide plain of dust and wind.<br>Jonah&#x2019;s grandfather&#x2019;s house was a few miles outside of the small town of Little Bow, where Jonah went to school. It was a narrow, mustard-colored farmhouse with a cottonwood beside it and a spindly chokecherry bush in front. These were the only trees in view, and his grandfather&#x2019;s place was the only house. From time to time a train would pass by on the railroad tracks that ran parallel to the house. Then the windows would hum like the tuning fork their teacher had shown them in school. This is how sound feels, their teacher said, and let them hold their fingers near the vibrating tines.<br><br>Sometimes it seemed to Jonah that everything was very small. In the center of his grandfather&#x2019;s bare backyard, an empty pint of cream would be the house and a line of matchbook cars, Scotch-taped end to end, would be the train. He didn&#x2019;t know why he liked the game so much, but he remembered playing it over and over, imagining himself and his mother and his grandfather and his grandfather&#x2019;s dog, Elizabeth, all of them inside the little pint container, and himself (another part of himself) leaning over them like a giant or a thundercloud, pushing his makeshift train slowly past.<br>He didn&#x2019;t call to his grandfather when he came into the house that day. The door banged shut, the furniture sat silently. He could hear the television talking in his grandfather&#x2019;s room, so he knew his grandfather was there, dozing in the little windowless room, an addition to the house, just space enough for his grandfather&#x2019;s bed and a dresser, a small TV and a lamp with curlicues of cigarette smoke around them. His grandfather was propped up against some pillows, drinking beer; an old blanket, pilled cotton, silk edges unraveling, was thrown across his grandfather&#x2019;s middle, an ashtray balanced on it. Tired. His grandfather worked as a janitor, he went to work early in the morning, while it was still dark. Sometimes when Jonah came home from school, his grandfather would come out of his room and tell Jonah stories or jokes, or he would complain about things, about being tired, about Jonah&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;What&#x2019;s the problem with her now? Did you do something to get her mad? I didn&#x2019;t do anything to her!&#x2014;and he would swear about people that he didn&#x2019;t like, people who had cheated him, or maybe he would smile and call Elizabeth to him, Babygirl, babygirl, what are you doing there, does a babygirl want a piece of lunch meat does she? and Elizabeth would come clicking her nails across the floor, her bobbed tail almost vibrating as she wagged it, her eyes full of love as Jonah&#x2019;s grandfather crooned to her.<br><br>But Jonah&#x2019;s grandfather didn&#x2019;t come out of his room that day, and Jonah dropped his bookbag to the floor of the kitchen. There was the smell of smoke, and fried eggs, and the old food in the refrigerator. Unwashed dishes in the sink. His grandfather&#x2019;s door was half-closed, and Jonah sat at the kitchen table for a time, eating cereal.<br>His mother was at work. He didn&#x2019;t know whether he missed her or not, but he thought of her as he sat there in the still kitchen. She worked at a place called Harmony Farm, packing eggs, she said, and the tone of her voice made him imagine dark labyrinths with rows of nests, a promenade of sad, dirty workers moving slowly through the passageways.<br><br>She wouldn&#x2019;t talk about it when she got home. Often, she wouldn&#x2019;t want to talk at all, wouldn&#x2019;t want to be touched, would make their supper, which she herself wouldn&#x2019;t eat. She would go to her room and listen to old records she&#x2019;d had since she was in junior high, her eyes open and her hands in a praying shape beneath her cheek, her long hair spread out behind her on the pillow.<br>He could stand there for a very long time, watching her from the edge of the doorway and she wouldn&#x2019;t move. The needle of the phonograph pulsed like a smooth car along the spiraling track of a record album and her eyes seemed to register the music more than anything else, her blinking coinciding with a pause or a beat.<br><br>But he knew that she could see him standing there. They were looking at each other, and it was a sort of game&#x2014;to try to blink when she blinked, to set his mouth in the same shape as her mouth, to hear what she was hearing. It was a sort of game to see how far he could inch into the room, sliding his feet the way a leaf opens, and sometimes he was almost to the center of the room before she finally spoke.<br><br>Get out, she would say, almost dreamily.<br><br>And then she would turn her face away from him, toward the wall.<br>He thought of her as his spoon hovered over his cereal. One day, he thought, she wouldn&#x2019;t come home from work. Or she might disappear in the night. He had awakened a few times: footsteps on the stairs, in the kitchen, the back door opening. From the upstairs window he saw her forcing her arm into the sleeve of her coat as she walked down the driveway. Her face was strange in the pale brightness cast by the floodlights that his grandfather had installed outside the house. Her breath lifted up out of her in the cold and drifted like mist, trailing behind her as she moved into the darkness beyond the circle of porch light.<br><br>We won&#x2019;t be staying long, she would tell Jonah sometimes. She would talk about the places where they used to live as if they&#x2019;d just come to Jonah&#x2019;s grandfather&#x2019;s house for a visit, even though they&#x2019;d been living there for as long as he could remember&#x2014;almost three years. He didn&#x2019;t remember much about the other places she talked about. Chicago. Denver. Fresno. Had he been to these cities? He wasn&#x2019;t sure. Sometimes things came in flashes and images, not really memories at all&#x2014;a staircase leading down, with muddy boots outside of it; a man with a fringed jacket like Davy Crockett, asleep on a couch while Jonah looked inside his open mouth; a lamp with autumn leaves patterned on it; a cement shower stall where he and his mother had washed together. Sometimes he thought he remembered the other baby, the one that had been born before him. I was very young, she told him. That was all she would tell. I was very young. I had to give it away.<br><br>I remember the baby, he said once, when they were sitting together talking, when she was feeling friendly, holding him in her arms, running her fingernails lightly back and forth across his cheek. I remember the baby, he said, and her face grew stiff. She took her hand away.<br><br>No, you don&#x2019;t, she said. Don&#x2019;t be stupid. You weren&#x2019;t even born yet. She sat there for a moment, regarding him, and then she shut her eyes, her teeth tightening against one another as if the sight of him hurt her. Jesus Christ, she said. Why don&#x2019;t you just forget I ever told you anything. I mean, I confide in you with something that&#x2019;s very private, and very important, and you want to play little pretend games? Are you a baby?<br><br>She sat there coldly, frowning, and began to gather and arrange her hair, ignoring him. She had long hair that reached almost to the belt-loops of her jeans. His grandfather said she looked like the country singer Crystal Gayle. Don&#x2019;t you think she looks pretty, Jonah? his grandfather would say when he was trying to cheer her up, but she would only smile a little, not really happy. He watched as she shook a cigarette from her pack on the coffee table and lit it.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t look at me that way, she said. She took a sip of smoke from her cigarette, and he tried to make his expression settled and neutral, to make his face the way she might want it to be.<br><br>Mom? he said.<br><br>What?<br><br>Where do babies go when you give them away? He wanted to make his voice sound innocent, to talk in the way a child on television might ask about Santa Claus. He wanted to pretend to be a certain type of child, to see if she might believe in it.<br><br>But she didn&#x2019;t. Where do babies go when you give them away? she repeated, in a high, insipid voice, and she didn&#x2019;t look at him, she didn&#x2019;t think he was cute or forgivable. He watched the rustle of her long hair, her hand as she ran the head of her cigarette against the rim of the ashtray.<br><br>They go to live with nice mommies, she said. After a moment she&#x2019;d shrugged darkly, not liking him anymore, not wanting to talk.<br>But he did remember the baby, he thought. He and his mother had seen it at the market, being watched by a lady he didn&#x2019;t know. The baby was pink-skinned, and had a tiny head without hair on it and it was inside something&#x2014;a basket, he thought, a basket like apples came in at the grocery store. The baby was dressed in a green velvet suit with a Santa&#x2019;s head on it, and rested on a red cushion. It moved its hands blindly, as if trying to catch air. Look, his mother said. There&#x2019;s my baby! And a lady had looked at them, stiffening as his mother bent down to wave her fingers over the baby&#x2019;s line of vision. The lady had looked at them, smiling but also frightened, and she had spoken to Jonah sharply.<br><br>Please don&#x2019;t touch, the lady said. Your hands are dirty.<br><br>He remembered this vividly&#x2014;not only because of the baby but because of the lady&#x2019;s eyes, the way she looked at him, the sharp sound of her voice. It was the first time he really understood that there was something about him that people didn&#x2019;t like.</p><h2>Protect and Defend (Kerry Kilcannon)</h2><p>On a cold day in January President Kerry Kilcannon takes the oath of office-- and within days makes his first, most important move: appointing a new Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Kilcannon's choice is a female judge with a brilliant record. And a secret. <br><br>While the Senate spars over Caroline Masters' nomination, an inflammatory abortion rights case is making its way toward the judge--and will explode into the headlines. Suddenly, the most divisive issue in America turns the President's nomination into all-out war. And from Judge Masters to a conservative, war-hero senator facing a crisis of conscience and a fifteen-year-old girl battling for her future, no one will be safe.<i> Protect and Defend</i> takes us on a riveting journey between what is legal, what is right . . . and the price of finally knowing the difference.</p><p>Richard North Patterson, whose legal thrillers have won him legions of devoted mystery fans, shows off his superb pacing and narrative gifts as well as his ability to create vividly realized characters in this compelling novel of late-term abortion, parental consent, and the battle over a nominee for chief justice of the Supreme Court. Unlike Patterson's typical courtroom dramas, the name of this game isn't murder; it's the body politic that's bleeding. When newly elected Democratic president Kerry Kilcannon nominates appeals court judge Caroline Masters to the top spot on the court, he knows he'll have a fight on his hands. Leading the opposition is his political rival, MacDonald Gage, the GOP majority leader who owes his soul and career to the Christian right wing. They're suspicious of Masters even before a politically charged case involving a teenager whose parents refuse to allow her to terminate a disastrous pregnancy ends up in her court. More principled than Gage, but equally adamant, is Republican senator Chad Palmer, who, like Masters, harbors his own potentially career-destroying secret. <p> Masters is an intriguing character, a woman whose judicial integrity, personal privacy, and political ambitions collide when she casts a tie-breaking vote on the constitutionality of the recently enacted Protection of Life bill. Not only young Mary Anne Tierney's future is at stake: so are the reproductive rights of all women, the resilience of the judicial system, and the personal lives of innocent bystanders who will be sacrificed on the altar of the First Amendment--the public's right to know, and the media's right to tell. Moving swiftly between the courts of public opinion and the federal judiciary, from San Francisco to the nation's capital, Patterson tells a mesmerizing story that's been praised by political and legal luminaries such as Mario Cuomo, Barbara Boxer, and Alan Dershowitz. But don't let that stop you. This up-to-date version of <i>Advise and Consent</i> is a provocative read that will resonate with political junkies as well as those who've made bestsellers out of Patterson's more typical genre thrillers. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><b>"<i>PROTECT AND DEFEND</i> IS A WINNER. . . .

Masaoka Shiki (1867&#x2013;1902) is credited with modernizing Japan's two traditional verse forms, haiku and tanka. Born at a time of social and cultural change in Japan, Shiki welcomed the new influences from the West and responded to them by reinvigorating the native haiku and tanka forms. He freed them from outdated conventions, made them viable for artistic expression in modern Japan, and paved the way for the haiku to become one of his nation's most influential cultural exports.<br><br>Burton Watson's excellent introduction explores the course of Shiki's life: his poverty-stricken childhood, his early love for literature, his education, and his work as a haiku editor for the newspaper <i>Nippon,</i> and as a correspondent during the Sino-Japanese war. Watson details Shiki's long struggle with tuberculosis and its poignant expression in his poetry. Confined to bed for months before his death, Shiki continued to devote his energies to literary pursuits: writing poems and critical essays, and joining with friends and followers who gathered in his sickroom to discuss literature. He died a few weeks before his thirty-fifth birthday. These poems&#x2015;more than a hundred haiku, several tanka, and three kanshi&#x2015;are arranged chronologically within each genre, revealing the development of Shiki's art and the seamless way in which he wove his life and illness into his poetry.</p><p>These poems&#x2015;more than a hundred haiku, several tanka, and three kanshi&#x2015;are arranged chronologically within each genre, revealing the development of Masaoka Shiki's (1867-1902) art and the seamless way in which he wove his life and illness into his poetry. Watson's introduction deftly explores the course of Shiki's life and places him in relation to Japanese history, literature and thought.Burton Watson is one of the world's best-known translators from the Chinese and Japanese.

What she really needs for her paper, though, is a big story. And she gets it--when handsome Mark Doukas, grandson of rich, old Neeny Doukas is murdered. Emma discovers that trying to get straight answers out of Neeny and his thin-lipped son is like poking a nest of sleeping rattlesnakes. What begins with an innocent story about the murdered man, ends with Emma conducting the most interesting, and probably the last, interview of her career from the wrong end of a .38....</p><p>Mary Daheim and I go back a long way -- well, seventeen or eighteen years. That's a long time for a publishing association. Years before I became Mary's editor on the Emma Lord/Alpine series for Ballantine, I was an editorial assistant at another trade house -- and that's where we met, long distance. She lives in Seattle; I live in New York; even eighteen year ago, the phone lines stretched in both directions. At the time Mary was writing successful historical romances for my then-boss, a senior editor. One day Mary and I revealed our unbridled passion for reading crime fiction. Little did I dream then that, soon after I arrived at Ballantine, Mary would become a crime writer herself. Of course, now she's a nationally renowned one . . . and I especially treasure her novels about Emma Lord, the editor-publisher of a small-town weekly newspaper in fictional (but based on fact) Alpine, Washington. The paper is called The Alpine Advocate, which is also the title of the first novel in the series. For any readers who haven't visited Alpine, I heartily recommend starting with Book One -- and then continuing forward (in alphabetical order) to THE ALPINE BETRAYAL, THE ALPINE CHRISTMAS, THE ALPINE DECOY, THE ALPINE ESCAPE, THE ALPINE FURY, THE ALPINE GAMBLE, THE ALPINE HERO, THE ALPINE ICON, THE ALPINE JOURNEY, and (coming soon) THE ALPINE KINDRED.<br><br>--Joe Blades, Associate Publisher<b>Mary Richardson Daheim</b>&nbsp;started spinning stories before she could spell. Daheim has been a journalist, an editor, a public relations consultant, and a freelance writer, but fiction was always her medium of choice. In 1982, she launched a career that is now distinguished by more than sixty novels. In 2000, she won the Literary Achievement Award from the Pacific Northwest Writers Association. In October 2008, she was inducted into the University of Washington&#x2019;s Communication Alumni Hall of Fame. Daheim lives in her hometown of Seattle and is a direct descendant of former residents of the real Alpine, which existed as a logging town from 1910 to 1929, when it was abandoned after the mill was closed. The Alpine/Emma Lord series has created interest in the site, which was named a Washington State ghost town in July 2011. An organization called the Alpine Advocates has been formed to preserve what remains of the town as a historic site.</p><h2>So B.

Perfect for fans of Rebecca Stead's <em>When You Reach Me</em> and Ali Benjamin's <em>The Thing About Jellyfish</em>.</p><p>She doesn't know when her birthday is or who her father is. In fact, everything about Heidi and her mentally disabled mother's past is a mystery. When a strange word in her mother's vocabulary begins to haunt her, Heidi sets out on a cross-country journey in search of the secrets of her past.</p><p>Far away from home, pieces of her puzzling history come together. But it isn't until she learns to accept not knowing that Heidi truly arrives.</p></p><p>One day in her apartment in Reno, Bernadette heard a pitiful sound in the hallway. She opened the door a crack and saw a young woman standing there in her raincoat, her bare legs spattered with dried mud, holding a crying baby wrapped in a blanket. The baby was Heidi, and they had come from the almost-empty apartment next door for help. Heidi's Mama can't tend her week-old child because she has, as Heidi later says, "a bum brain," so Bernadette steps in and cares for them both tenderly. Mama says her name is "So Be It," but with her twenty-three-word vocabulary, this is all the information she can give Bernadette.<p> Twelve years later this strange but loving household is still together. Heidi does the shopping because Bernadette has "angora phobia," and pays for it with money she wins at the laundromat; Bernadette teaches her at the kitchen table while Mama is happily occupied with her coloring books, and the rent and utilities are always mysteriously paid. But Heidi wonders who she is, where she and Mama came from, why they were alone, and most of all, she wants to know the meaning of Mama's word "soof." When she finds some old photos in a cupboard, she knows where to go to find out, and as she sets out on a long cross-country bus journey, the pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into surprising places in this intriguing and heartwarming mystery. (Ages 10 to 14) <i>--Patty Campbell</i></p><p>You couldn&#x2032;t really tell about Mama&#x2032;s brain just from looking at her, but it was obvious as soon as she spoke. She had a high voice, like a little girl&#x2032;s, and she only knew twenty-three words. I know this for a fact, because we kept a list of the things Mama said tacked to the inside of the kitchen cabinet. Most of the words were common ones, like good and more and hot, but there was one word only my mother said, soof. </p><p>Although she lives an unconventional lifestyle with her mentally disabled mother and their doting neighbor, Bernadette, Heidi has a lucky streak that has a way of pointing her in the right direction. When a mysterious word in her mother&#x2032;s vocabulary begins to haunt her, Heidi&#x2032;s thirst for the truth leads her on a cross-country journey in search of the secrets of her past. </p><p>A dramatic tour de force by the best-selling author of Regular Guy. </p></p><h2>Wonderland: An Anthology</h2><p><b><b>From the greatest names in fantasy and horror comes an anthology of stories inspired by </b><b><i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.</i></b></b><br><br>Join Alice as she is thrown into the whirlwind of Wonderland<br><br>Within these pages you'll find myriad approaches to Alice, from horror to historical, taking us from the nightmarish reaches of the imagination to tales that will shock, surprise and tug on the heart-strings.

"We've taken your<br>daughter hostage."<br><br>She was in the parking garage beneath her condo, hauling<br>a box of files from the back of her car, when he approached<br>her. She wasn't even a hundred feet away from Ramon, the<br>building's security guard.<br><br>The smiling man must've seen the confusion in her eyes, be-cause<br>he said it again. In a Kazbekistani dialect. "We have your<br>daughter, and if you don't follow our orders, we'll kill her."<br><br>And this time, Meg understood. Amy. She dropped the box.<br><br>"Everything okay over there, Ms. Moore?" Ramon was<br>down off his stool, starting toward them. There'd recently<br>been a rape in another parking garage in this part of Washington,<br>DC.<br><br>"Tell him yes," the smiling man murmured, opening<br>his baseball jacket, giving her a flash of a very deadly<br>looking gun.<br><br>Oh, God. "Where is she?"<br><br>"If I don't make a phone call to my associates within the<br>next hour, she's dead," he told her as he bent down to pick up<br>the box. "My associates are Kazbekistani Extremists."<br><br>Terrorists. But not just regular terrorists. The Extremists<br>were religious zealots, capable of terrible violence and cruelty,<br>all in the name of their god. And they had Amy.<br><br>Oh, God.<br><br>"Everything's fine," Meg called to the guard, her voice shaking<br>only slightly.<br><br>"We're old college friends." The man turned his friendly<br>smile on Ramon. "I thought I recognized Meggie. I didn't<br>mean to appear before her like the ghost of Christmas past,<br>though, and scare her half to death."<br><br>Ramon's hand was on the gun holstered at his waist. He<br>smiled politely, but his dark brown gaze was on Meg. "Ms.<br>Moore?"<br><br>Help.<br><br>She'd prepared for situations like this, back when she was<br>working at the American embassy in Kazbekistan, an Eastern<br>European country also know as K-stan or "the Pit" to<br>the Americans who served time there. During her stay, she<br>was reminded regularly that the United States didn't negotiate<br>with terrorists. The best solution was preventive--stay<br>safe, stay secure, stay away from dangerous persons and<br>situations.<br><br>It was a little late for that now--although who would have<br>thought a K-stani terrorist would show up here in Washing-ton,<br>all these years later?<br><br>Meg knew what she should do in this situation. She<br>should enlist Ramon's help while this man held her box of<br>files, while his hands were full and he couldn't easily reach<br>for his gun. She should be a strong American and refuse to<br>negotiate with terrorists. She should seek help from the FBI.<br><br>Who, no matter how good they were, wouldn't be able to<br>find her ten-year-old daughter within the next sixty minutes.<br><br>After which time Amy would be killed.<br><br>Meg forced a smile. American be damned. She was playing<br>this one out as Amy's very frightened mother. "It's all<br>right, Ramon," she lied. "We're . . . old friends."<br><br>"How about I carry this upstairs for you?" The man continued<br>the charade. His English was remarkably good--he<br>had only the faintest of accents. "We could talk about old<br>times over a cup of coffee."<br><br>"Great." She smiled again at Ramon, who watched them<br>all the way over to the elevators.<br><br>"Where is she?" Meg hissed from behind her frozen<br>smile. "Where's Amy? And what about my grandmother?"<br>Amy had planned to take her great-grandmother, Eve, to the<br>Smithsonian while Meg picked up these files she'd been<br>hired to translate. Meg hadn't been sure exactly who was the<br>baby-sitter--the ten-year-old or the seventy-five-year-old.<br><br>"The old lady's your grandmother." He nodded as he<br>pressed the elevator's call button. "I thought she was too old<br>to be your mother. We've got her, too."<br><br>Meg felt a rush of relief. At least Eve was with Amy. At<br>least Amy wasn't alone and terrified and . . . "I don't under-stand.<br>I'm not rich, and--"<br><br>"We don't want your money." The elevator doors opened<br>and he stood back, politely letting her on first--the perfect<br>terrorist gentleman. "We want you to do us a little favor."<br>Oh, God.<br><br>"You frequently do business at the Kazbekistani embassy<br>across town, right?"<br><br>Oh, mighty God. The doors slid closed, but she kept her<br>smile in place. Ramon would be watching through the security<br>cameras.<br><br>"I only work as a consultant, a translator. It's never, I<br>never . . ."<br><br>He pushed the button for twelve. Somehow this man she'd<br>never seen before knew she and Amy lived on the twelfth<br>floor.<br><br>Meg took a deep breath and tried again. "Look, I'm not<br>allowed into any areas inside the embassy that contain confidential<br>information or--"<br><br>"We don't want you to spy for us. We already have an agent<br>in place inside the embassy for that purpose." He laughed and<br>it wasn't purely for the cameras. This man was enjoying him-self,<br>amused by her fear.<br><br>A fear that morphed hotly into anger as she turned her<br>back to the security camera. "Then what do you want, damn<br>it? How do I even know you've got Amy and Eve?"<br><br>The elevator doors opened at the twelfth floor. He stepped<br>back, again to let her go first. "If you like, we'll send you the<br>old lady's head in a box--"<br><br>"No!" Oh, God.<br><br>He laughed again. "Then I guess you've just got to trust<br>me, don't you, Meggie?"<br><br>Meg's hands were shaking so badly, she couldn't get her<br>key into the lock.<br><br>He shifted the box to one arm and a hip as he gently took<br>her key ring from her, opened the door, and pushed her in-side,<br>following her into her living room. "I'm afraid I can't<br>be as trusting," he continued, setting her box next to the<br>couch. "After we discuss strategy and negotiate terms, I'm<br>going to drive with you over to the embassy. I know it's after<br>five, but there's a function tonight. Nothing formal. You can<br>wear jeans. In fact, I want you to wear jeans. With those<br>boots you have. What are they called? Cowboy boots. Or<br>should it be cowgirl boots?"<br><br>"Negotiate terms?" Meg didn't give a damn what she<br>wore. "What terms?"<br><br>"Well, it's actually a pretty simple negotiation with only<br>one or two minor points. But the bottom line is that if you<br>want to see your daughter and grandmother again, you'll do<br>what we tell you to do. If you don't . . ."<br><br>"I do."<br><br>"Good." He crossed to the windows, pulled the curtains.<br><br>"Once you're in the embassy, our inside agent will keep an<br>eye on you. If you make any attempt to get help or to contact<br>the authorities at any time, we will kill your daughter. Have<br>absolutely no doubt about that."<br><br>His smile was gone.<br><br>Meg nodded. She didn't doubt him. After living and<br>working in Kazbekistan for years, she knew quite well what<br>the Extremists were capable of.<br><br>"What do you want me to do?"</p><h2>Fancy Nancy: Nancy Clancy, Soccer Mania (Nancy Clancy, 6)</h2><p><p><strong>Nancy Clancy hits the soccer field in <em>New York Times</em> bestselling team Jane O&#x2019;Connor and Robin Preiss Glasser&#x2019;s sixth Nancy Clancy chapter book.</strong></p><p>Normally, Nancy doesn&#x2019;t like dressing like everyone else.

Arranging can be divided into two separate processes. The first deals with scoring and transcribing. Scoring is concerned with such things as voicing, doubling, balance and color. The term scoring also means the actual writing of notes on the score paper. Transcribing is scoring music written for one kind of musical instrument or group -- say a piano or orchestra -- for a different kind of group. This text deals with those matters. The second part of arranging is the more creative process of writing introductions, modulations, endings, background figures and so on.</p><p></p><h2>Prince Valiant Vol. 11: 1957-1958</h2><p>The eleventh volume of Fantagraphics award-winning Prince Valiant series concludes our heroes�&#x20ac;&#x2122; adventures in Cornwall, and marks the first appearance of Arvak the Red Stallion.

It can be said with some certainty that early Carolingian military success was built on good leadership, adequate administration, and troops whose morale was almost consistently superb. It is also clear that the Carolingian army managed to adapt itself to face many and differing foes. This absorbing text by David Nicolle explores the organization and history of the Carolingian Empire during the age of one of history&#39;s most romanticised and heroic figures - Charlemagne.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.David Nicolle PhD was born in 1944 and was educated at Highgate School.

Le Guin</p><h2>Interpreting the English Village: Landscape and Community at Shapwick, Somerset</h2><p>An original and approachable account of how archaeology can tell the story of the English village. Shapwick lies in the middle of Somerset, next to the important monastic center of Glastonbury: the abbey owned the manor for 800 years from the 8th to the 16th century and its abbots and officials had a great influence on the lives of the peasants who lived there. It is possible that abbot Dunstan, one of the great reformers of tenth century monasticism directed the planning of the village. <br>The Shapwick Project examined the development and history of an English parish and village over a ten thousand-year period. This was a truly multidisciplinary project. Not only were a battery of archaeological and historical techniques explored - such as field walking, test-pitting, archaeological excavation, aerial reconnaissance, documentary research and cartographic analysis - but numerous other techniques such as building analysis, dendrochronological dating and soil analysis were undertaken on a large scale. <br>The result is a fascinating study about how the community lived and prospered in Shapwick. In addition we learn how a group of enthusiastic and dedicated scholars unraveled this story. As such there is much here to inspire and enthuse others who might want to embark on a landscape study of a parish or village area. Seven of the ten chapters begin with a fictional vignette to bring the story of the village to life. <br>Text-boxes elucidate reoccurring themes and techniques. Extensively illustrated in color including 100 full page images.<br>This title was the winner of the 2014 British Archaeological Association's Best Archaeological Book Award.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>1.

Wider Contexts</p><p>Although reviewing is always a pleasurable occupation, it is rarely that a book of this quality is received, and even more rare that a reviewer can be sure that a classic, which will be consulted for decades to come, has come her way. This is one of those books, and it is a great regret that Mick Aston will not see its success. (Susan Oosthuizen <i>Landscape History, Vol. 34, No. 2, 2013</i>)<br><br>All in all, the book is an excellent compilation of the history of Shapwick by authors who believe firmly in the continuity of the landscape.

(David Austin <i>Landscapes, June 2014 (Vol.15, No.1)</i>)<br><br>One of the book's challenges to the reader is the fact that it is jam- packed full of ten years of research. The authors have been able to put together an interpretation of Shapwick's landscape, and the people who shaped it, that can inspire new ways of academic research as well as new ways of incorporating a broader base of public interest into programs and research projects that show value to the people they affect. This of course was always a notable strength of Mick Aston, and one of the reasons he will be greatly missed. (Melanie C.

This is a great example of the public archaeology output from landscape archaeology, and I recommend it wholeheartedly. (K. Kris Hirst <i>About.com Archaeology Guide, 2013</i>)<br><br>...an inspiring example of a local study carried out by the people, about the people and written for the people... yet it might well be asked why it should merit a place on the bookshelves of enthusiasts of archaeology in Cornwall, or other places [outside of] Shapwick [and Somerset]. Quite simply, besides being a good read, it provides a possible model for others to follow in their own communities. Not only does it show how various disciplines have been applied but it is clear to follow, without the jargon that can be so daunting, and abundantly supplied with maps, so strangers can locate the places named with ease... Every parish deserves this treatment. (Roger Smith <i>Cornwall Archaeological Society Newsletter</i>)<br><br>Fascinating, compelling and never patronising, this magnificent book is popular archaeology at its best. I cannot recommend it too highly. 10/10 (Steve Marshall <i>Fortean Times, 301</i>)<br><br>Mick Aston was one of the presenters of the British "Time Team" archaeology programme, who died in 2013; this book is a great tribute to his knowledge, expertise and enthusiasm about all things archaeological.

Known collectively as Apaches, these Indians lived in diverse, widely scattered groups with many names&#x2014;Mescaleros, Chiricahuas, and Jicarillas, to name but three. Much has been written about them and their leaders, such as Geronimo, Juh, Nana, Victorio, and Mangas Coloradas, but no one wrote extensively about the greatest leader of them all: Cochise. Now, however, Edwin R. Sweeney has remedied this deficiency with his definitive biography.</p><p>Cochise, a Chiricahua, was said to be the most resourceful, most brutal, most feared Apache. He and his warriors raided in both Mexico and the United States, crossing the border both ways to obtain sanctuary after raids for cattle, horses, and other livestock. Once only he was captured and imprisoned; on the day he was freed he vowed never to be taken again. From that day he gave no quarter and asked none. Always at the head of his warriors in battle, he led a charmed life, being wounded several times but always surviving.</p><p>In 1861, when his brother was executed by Americans at Apache Pass, Cochise declared war. He fought relentlessly for a decade, and then only in the face of overwhelming military superiority did he agree to a peace and accept the reservation. Nevertheless, even though he was blamed for virtually every subsequent Apache depredation in Arizona and New Mexico, he faithfully kept that peace until his death in 1874.</p><p>Sweeney has traced Cochise&#x2019;s activities in exhaustive detail in both United States and Mexican Archives. We are not likely to learn more about Cochise than he has given us. His biography will stand as the major source for all that is yet to be written on Cochise.</p></p><p>Retired as a professional accountant, <b>Edwin R. Sweeney</b> is an independent scholar and the author of <i>Cochise: Chiricahua Apache Chief</i>; <i>Mangas Coloradas: Chief of the Chiricahua Apaches</i>; and <i>From Cochise to Geronimo: The Chiricahua Apaches, 1874&#x2013;1886.</i>Without solid knowledge of Southwestern geography and history, readers will find themselves overwhelmed by the wealth of detail in this well-documented, exhaustive biography. For more than 40 years, Apache bands fought Mexican and American troops in the borderlands between New Mexico and Arizona, Chihuahua and Sonora. In his first book, Sweeney gives a brief introduction to the Apaches and their culture, focusing on Cochise's band, the central Chiricahuas. Cochise was born about 1810, a time of relative peace in northern Mexico when the government supplied rations to the Indians. After the Mexican Revolution (1821), funds were not available, assistance was cut and Apaches started raiding ranches for cattle and horses. By the time Cochise reached maturity, hostilities were widespread. A resourceful and feared warrior, he became the undisputed leader of the Chiricahuas. Trailing Cochise through nearly every skirmish and battle of his career, the narrative is a veritable catalogue of persecution, treachery and cruelty on both sides. In the early 1870s, Cochise accepted peace; he died in 1874.

As first son, he has responsibilities, too. But times are bad in Nigeria, and life is hard. Unable to find work, Kingsley cannot take on the duty of training his younger siblings, nor can he provide his parents with financial peace in their retirement. And then there is Ola. Dear, sweet Ola, the sugar in Kingsley's tea. It does not seem to matter that he loves her deeply; he cannot afford her bride price.<br><br> It hasn't always been like this. For much of his young life, Kingsley believed that education was everything, that through wisdom, all things were possible. Now he worries that without a "long-leg"--someone who knows someone who can help him--his degrees will do nothing but adorn the walls of his parents' low-rent house. And when a tragedy befalls his family, Kingsley learns the hardest lesson of all: education may be the language of success in Nigeria, but it's money that does the talking.<br><br> Unconditional family support may be the way in Nigeria, but when Kingsley turns to his Uncle Boniface for help, he learns that charity may come with strings attached. Boniface--aka Cash Daddy--is an exuberant character who suffers from elephantiasis of the pocket. He's also rumored to run a successful empire of email scams. But he can help. With Cash Daddy's intervention, Kingsley and his family can be as safe as a tortoise in its shell. It's up to Kingsley now to reconcile his passion for knowledge with his hunger for money, and to fully assume his role of first son. But can he do it without being drawn into this outlandish milieu?</p><p>Adaobi Nwaumbani grew up in the Eastern part of Nigeria, among the Igbo speaking people who are actually the major culprits of 419. This is her first novel.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Chris Cleave "Dear Friend, I do not come to you by chance. Upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign business man or company, I was given your contact by the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I hope that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude." The feelings that such unsolicited e-mails provoke -- impatience, scorn, amusement -- make most of us click the delete button daily. Nigerian e-mail scams are so notorious that few of us give them a thought. And yet these missives are an unsung literary form, a river of wheedling, flattery and grasping that flows directly from the desires of the human heart. The young Nigerian writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani is determined to follow them back to their source. Her pointed and poignant first novel is a lively, good-humored and provocative examination of the truth behind a global inbox of deceit. As the story opens, Kingsley, a first-born son, struggles to provide for his beloved family when his ailing father's income dwindles. Possessed of a fine mind but poorly connected in the corrupt Nigerian job market, Kingsley falls in with his notorious uncle, Cash Daddy, the larger-than-life mastermind of a thousand e-mail scams. A silver-tongued cross between Homer Simpson and Col. Kurtz, Cash Daddy is a conman of blubbery greed, chilling wisdom, offbeat charm and unabashed naked exhibitionism -- all delightfully rendered. As Kingsley puts it, "He could probably even talk a spider into weaving silk socks for him." As Kingsley falls reluctantly under his mentor's spell and discovers his own innate flair for the art of the confidence trick, Nwaubani takes us deeper into the intricate world of the Nigerian e-mail scam. She wears her research lightly; the detailed exposition of the methods deployed to string along Western suckers is fascinating and often funny. In one scene, a young Nigerian man, to the uproarious encouragement of his friends, masquerades as a buxom makeup artist from New Jersey and texts a libidinous Salt Lake City man until he wires $4,000 against the promise that his "babe" will come to visit him. Nwaubani further enlivens such winning vignettes with fearless similes: "It felt as if a gallon of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane had been pumped into my heart," Kingsley says, "and set alight with a stick of match." As the scams increase in scale and audacity, the novel begins to accomplish something more than simply poking fun at the lust and rapacity that make a small but lucrative fraction of Westerners susceptible to such scams. Significantly, the names of Nwaubani's suckers are not Smith and Jones but rather Rumsfeld, Albright, Condoleezza and Letterman; they are little people with big people's names and emotional resonance. The reader is thus invited to see the whole fraught relationship between Africa and the West in the microcosm of these deceptively simple e-mails from Nigeria. There is a pulsating anger underneath all the tricks and the levity. When challenged regarding the immorality of ripping off unsuspecting Westerners, Nwaubani's characters explicitly cite slavery and the Western exploitation of the Niger Delta's oil wealth as justification; they're merely repatriating capital that they feel was taken from them unjustly. The picture is further complicated by the charitable use to which a great deal of the embezzled money is put in the novel: building schools, paving roads and funding orphanages. "No matter what the media proclaimed," says Kingsley, "we were not villains, and the good people of Eastern Nigeria knew it." Nwaubani's subversive skill lies in telling us a familiar story from an unfamiliar angle. By making Robin Hood heroes of the vilified perpetrators of e-mail scams, she allows us to enjoy watching a potbellied pervert from Utah pay an African village kid's school fees. But Nwaubani does not ignore the moral difficulties of this arrangement, and indeed the emotional propulsion of the novel comes from Kingsley's own growing disgust at what he is becoming. This is not a flawless novel -- it is an original and heartfelt debut that occasionally offends against pacing and plausibility -- but its flaws are more than compensated for by Nwaubani's storytelling skill and the sharp pair of eyes she lends us. Western audiences have grown up with films such as "The Sting" and "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels," in which scammers are charming and their victims covetous and vile. In Western pop culture, when white folks go on the scam, it's a comedy -- or, if they do it on a truly grand scale, it's a taxpayer bailout -- yet when Africans go scamming, it's a crime. One of Nwaubani's many fine achievements in publishing her timely novel here is to give Westerners credit for beginning to move on from that. I hope we can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

I work here, I carry a badge. The story you are about to see is true..."</b><br>Before <i>Charlie's Angels, Miami Vice,</i> or <i>NYPD Blue,</i> there was <i>Dragnet</i>. From 1951 to 1959, Jack Webb starred as Sergeant Joe Friday in the most successful police drama in television history. Webb ("Just the facts, ma'am") was also the creator of <i>Dragnet</i>, and what made the show so revolutionary was its documentary-style format and the fact that each episode was "ripped" from the files of the LAPD. <br><br>But 1950s television censors deemed many of the stories in the LAPD's files too violent or sensational for the airwaves. <i>The Badge</i> is Webb's collection of stories that could not be presented on TV: untold, behind-the-scenes accounts of the Black Dahlia murder, the Brenda Allen confessions, Stephen Nash's "thrill murders," and Donald Bashor's "sleeping lady murders," to name just a few. Case by case, <i>The Badge</i> takes readers on a spine chilling police tour through the dark, shadowy world of Los Angeles crime.<br><b>"Some books influence a writer.

"Essence of Tantra" by the Dalai Lama discusses tantra for practice, refuge, the three paths, greatness of mantra, clear light, and initiation. "The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra--Part 1" by Tsongkhapa is one of the principal classic texts on tantra. It presents the main features common to all the Buddhist tantra systems as well as the differences between sutra and tantra. In this volume Tsongkhapa covers paths to Buddhahood, vajra vehicle, deity yoga, and method in the four tantras.

The authors of this book tell a different story.<br>That landscape the newcomers saw was not a wilderness, not untouched by nature. It was a landscape carefully managed by knowledgeable people to provide them with food, clothing, shelter, fuel, and tools. It was a landscape where the wilderness came later after Euro-Americans had stopped the controlled burning the Indians had practiced, drained the wet meadows that had preserved the water supplies, and fenced off the areas where Native California women's coppicing had encouraged the growth of choice basketry materials. This is a book for those interested in the beginnings of agriculture, for here, in the salubrious climate of California, peoples who lived mainly by hunting and gathering had taken, by the eighteenth century, many of the steps that make up the technology of agriculture. This is also a book for those interested in learning better ways to manage our environment now. Our Forest Service and parks have already acknowledged the value of controlled burning. We may some day catch up with Australia, where the aborigines participate in the management of the national parks because of their special knowledge.</p><p></p><h2>Some Trees (Yale Series of Younger Poets)</h2><p>A capsule of the imaginative life of the individual, <i>Some Trees</i> is the 52nd volume of the Yale Series of Younger Poets<br> &nbsp;<br> Comparing him to T.

Using previously unpublished diaries and letters, Tobias Churton traces Crowley&#x2019;s extensive travels through America and his quest to implant a new magical and spiritual consciousness in the United States, while working to undermine Germany&#x2019;s propaganda campaign to keep the United States out of World War I. <br><br>Masterfully recreating turn-of-the-century America in all its startling strangeness, Churton explains how Crowley arrived in New York amid dramatic circumstances in 1900. After other travels, in 1914 Crowley returned to the U.S. and stayed for five years: turbulent years that changed him, the world, and the face of occultism forever. Diving deeply into Crowley&#x2019;s 5-year stay, we meet artists, writers, spies, and government agents as we uncover Crowley&#x2019;s complex work for British and U.S. intelligence agencies. Exploring Crowley&#x2019;s involvement with the birth of the Greenwich Village radical art scene, we discover his relations with writers Sinclair Lewis and Theodore Dreiser and artists John Butler Yeats, Leon Engers Kennedy, and Robert Winthrop Chanler while living and lecturing on now-vanished &#x201c;Genius Row.&#x201d; We experience his love affairs and share Crowley&#x2019;s hard times in New Orleans and his return to health, magical dynamism, and the most colorful sex life in America. We examine his controversial political stunts, his role in the sinking of the passenger ship <i>Lusitania</i>, his making of the &#x201c;Elixir of Life&#x201d; in 1915, his psychedelic experimentation, his prolific literary achievements, and his run-in with Detroit Freemasonry. We also witness Crowley&#x2019;s influence on Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and rocket fuel genius Jack Parsons. We learn why J. Edgar Hoover wouldn&#x2019;t let Crowley back in the country and why the FBI raided Crowley&#x2019;s organization in LA. <br><br>Offering a 20th-century history of the occult movement in the United States, Churton shows how Crowley&#x2019;s U.S. visits laid the groundwork for the establishment of his syncretic &#x201c;religion&#x201d; of Thelema and the now flourishing OTO, as well as how Crowley&#x2019;s final wish was to have his ashes scattered in the Hamptons.</p><p>Britain&#x2019;s leading scholar of Western Esotericism, Tobias Churton is a world authority on Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism.

The celebration was somewhat marred by debates over wolf reintroduction, road improvement, resort building, and &#34;bioprospecting,&#34; the search for economically useful plant materials. Paul Schullery, a longtime resident and student of the park, tells us that such debates are not new. In his deeply personal yet sweeping history of Yellowstone, he shows that the place known from the start as &#34;Wonderland&#34; has always been the subject of pro- and anti-development forces, has always been seen through sometimes bitterly contrasting points of view. With balance and grace, Schullery weaves his narrative through countless such arguments, noting that &#34;Today&#39;s parks, for all the press of humanity lined up to get in, still seem short of friends, or at least lacking in just the right combination of friends to ensure adequate budgets and reasonable protection.&#34; His fine book may help widen Yellowstone&#39;s circle of champions.Yellowstone National Park is beloved passionately and, as with all objects of passion, it generates heated feelings and has for over 125 years. Created in 1872, Yellowstone has been at the center of efforts to conserve the nation's once vast western wilderness. In turn Yellowstone's history has demonstrated how complex those efforts to conserve it have been. As Schullery writes, "We inherited this great humming thing . . . Ever since then we have imagined ourselves wise enough to control it and have rushed to judge what is wrong with it. And every time we looked hard enough, we discovered that there was more wrong with our judgment than with Yellowstone."<br> <br>This marvelously detailed book skillfully and objectively traces the park's social and ecological history from Pleistocene times to the present. Searching for Yellowstone is an absolute "must read" for anyone wanting to understand why the park is engraved in the American consciousness.<br></p><h2>Thomas Ashley-Farrand&#39;s Healing Mantras</h2><p><p>Imagine uttering a simple pattern of sacred sounds and discovering that they promote physical healing, magnify the powers of the mind, and even attract abundance into our lives.

Nevertheless, in a daring counter-offensive on June 3, the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) reinforced the French and threw the Germans back across the Marne River. </p><p>Exhilarated by this success, the 2d Marine Division was tasked with taking the strategically significant Belleau Wood. On the Marines arrival the French were retreating in the face of the German onslaught, but the Marines defiantly declared "Retreat, hell! We just got here!" To take the wood the Marines marched through an exposed wheat field under fierce German fire, and suffered a staggering casualty rate.</p><p>The Marines, undaunted, reached the wood and bitterly struggled for 20 days, capturing and re-capturing it six times over, and finally securing the position against all odds, ending the last German offensive on the Western Front. The US forces suffered 9,777 casualties, took 1,800 German prisoners, and the wood was officially renamed Bois de la Brigade de Marine in honor of their courage and victory.</p><p>Discussing the strategy employed by the Allies and accompanied by original photographs and detailed maps, this book examines the two key battles that saw America's baptism of fire in World War I: Chateau Thierry and Belleau Wood.</p></p><p>David Bonk is a lifelong student of military history and an historical miniatures wargamer.

It is equally valuable from a devotional point of view. Jerome was a Church Father and famous ecclesiastical author who died in A.D. 420. His writings cover nearly all the principal departments of Christian theology, but the most numerous and important belong to that of Biblical study. Among the latter is his Commentary on Daniel, which is one of the most interesting and significant of his expository works. It is frequently consulted by the learned even to this day. It here appears for the first time in the English language. The manuscript here published in book form won form Dr. Archer the much coveted Certificate of Award presented by the Christian Research Foundation for the year&#39;s most important manuscript in the field of Biblical Research.</p><p></p><h2>The Illustrated Book of Heraldry: An International History Of Heraldry And Its Contemporary Uses</h2><p>This informative book looks not only at the medieval world in which heraldry thrived, but also at its language, the elaborate system of coded messages it conveyed, and its inextricable link with chivalry. Featuring more than 700 illustrations, it also covers both the larger aspects of heraldry and everyday heraldic uses, and contains a comprehensive glossary. The book examines the history of heraldry from medieval tournaments to modern applications around the world &#x2013; its origins and development, heralds and the Law of Arms, the coat of arms, messages and declarations, along with explanations of the applications of heraldry from royal heraldry and nobility, civic and state heraldry, and global heraldry, to the continuity of heraldry today &#x2013; and includes a detailed and easily understood explanation of the language of heraldry. The international uses of heraldry and the way different countries have interpreted it are explored, covering most of Europe and the Americas as well as Scandinavia, Africa and Japan. An informed look at all aspects of heraldry, this book is lavishly illustrated throughout with fascinating archive material, and specially commissioned artworks. Novices and experts alike will benefit from the breadth of the content of this masterly history. <br><p>&#x201c;This volume is the most international study of heraldry for a generation. Well known for his irreverent lectures, which bring obscure historical subjects to vibrant life, Stephen Slater&#x2019;s book is sure to appeal as much to the general reader as the enthusiast.&#x201d; Baz Manning, Society of Heraldic Artists. </p></p><p>Stephen Slater is a council member of The Heraldry Society of England, which exists to increase and extend interest in and knowledge of heraldry, armoury, chivalry, genealogy and allied subjects. He is active in other regional heraldic organizations. He has lectured widely on a variety of heraldic subjects, in particular on his own research on the heraldry of Europe and on local heraldry. Stephen writes articles on heraldry for numerous publications and has collaborated on several books.</p><h2>Sicilian Uncles</h2><p>The expression &#39;Sicilian uncle&#39; has the same sense in Italian as &#39;Dutch uncle&#39; does in English, but with sinister overtones of betrayal and inconstancy. The four novellas in Sicilian Uncles, originally published in 1958, are political thrillers of a kind - the first fruits of Sciascia&#39;s maturity. In these stories, illusions about ideology and history are lost in mirth, suffering and abandoned innocence. Each novella has its historical moment: the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Spanish Civil War, the death of Stalin, the &#39;events&#39; of 1848. These occasions and their consequences are registered in the lives of Sciascia&#39;s wonderfully drawn characters. Each has voice, wit and a private history which opens out onto the wider circumstances of his time.</p><p>Leonardo Sciascia was born in Sicily in 1912 and died there in 1989. Like Joseph Roth, Sciascia worked with deceptively simple forms - books about crime, historical novels, political thrillers - and was a master of lucid and accessible prose. This polished surface conceals great depths of sophistication and an intense engagement with the moral and historical problems of modern Italy, especially of his native Sicily. His books are rooted in a particular culture; they speak to anyone who has ever wondered how people can endure unbearable injustice.Text: English, Italian (translation)</p><h2>Love is a Radiant Light: The Life &amp; Words of Saint Charbel</h2><p>"A man who prays lives out the mystery of existence, and a man who does not pray scarcely exists." Thus writes St. Charbel Makhlouf (1828-1898), a Maronite monk and priest from Lebanon whose reputation for sanctity spread widely during his life, and whose heavenly intercession has worked countless miracles after his death. St. Charbel's homilies and proverbs are reminiscent of the sayings of the Desert Fathers: simple, homespun, and direct, yet shining and profound. "Success in life consists of standing without shame before God."&nbsp;<br><br>This holy monk speaks from a reservoir of silence about the fundamentals of the Faith and targets the temptations facing all Christians today: the flight from suffering, excessive attachment to comforts, pride over accomplishments, complacency, factiousness, substituting talk for action, fear of proclaiming the truth in an age of hostile unbelief. Alert to the reality of spiritual warfare, St. Charbel calls each one of us to hold fast to the Cross, "the center of the universe and the key to heaven," and defy the devil who seeks our ruin. This collection of some of the most beautiful words spoken by St. Charbel is augmented by a short biography that will bring him to the attention of those who have not yet made his acquaintance or profited from his wisdom.</p><p>"What a gift is this volume of the writings of St. Charbel Makhlouf! St. Charbel's spiritual counsel is as timely today in our media-saturated, chaotic culture as it was while he lived in the relative simplicity of 19th-century Lebanon. Among the many riches found here, his advice on prayer, the nature of the Church, and how to maintain the spiritual life in a world of distractions is truly nourishing."--<b>MICHAEL MARTIN</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Transfiguration</i><br><i></i><br>"The holy fool (<i>yurodivy</i>) is well known in Byzantine and Slavic Christianity. But the Syriac and Arab Christians of the Levant had their own fools for Christ, including the Maronite Catholic Saint Charbel. Like all true fools for Christ, he hid his brilliance of intellect and spirit, but we can now benefit from both by taking two minutes each day to read one of his short homilies, which are given here in clear, straightforward translation, calling us back to the simple and eternal truths of the gospel."--<b>ADAM A.J. DEVILLE</b>, University of Saint Francis<br><br>"Spiritual writing comes in many varieties. In recent centuries it has often veered towards a sentimental prolixity and emphasis on methodology. St. Charbel, a 19th-century Maronite monk, brings us a welcome contrast: succinct homilies full of memorable down-to-earth images and a no-nonsense message that proceeds from a disciplined heart overflowing with love. This little book delivers much to ponder with luminous brevity."--<b>PETER A. KWASNIEWSKI</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Tradition and Sanity</i></p><h2>Secret Asset</h2><p>Liz Carlyle, the quick, passionate intelligence officer of Britain's MI5, returns to defuse a terrorist plot in this high-stakes, high-tension tale of international espionage. When it appears a &#x201c;secret asset&#x201d;&#x2014;a sleeper spy&#x2014;has infiltrated British Intelligence, the Director of Counter-Terrorism assigns Liz Carlyle to dig up the mole. The spy, possibly a former IRA operative now working with British-born Al Qaeda sympathizers, has one thing on his (or her?) mind: total devastation. With a major attack looming, Liz must trust her instincts and move fast. But this assignment is deadly, and suddenly she feels like she has wandered into a wilderness of mirrors, where nothing is what is seems and no-one can be trusted.</p><p>Stella Rimington joined MI5 in 1965 and during her thirty-year career she worked in all the main fields of the Service's responsibilities--counter-subversion, counter-espionage, and counter-terrorism--and successively became Director of all three branches. Appointed Director-General of MI5 in 1992, she was the first woman to hold the post and the first Director-General whose name was publicly announced on appointment. Following her retirement from MI5 in 1996, she became a Non-Executive Director of Marks and Spencer and published her autobiography, <i>Open Secret</i>, in the UK.<b>Chapter One</b>In the upmarket bathroom shop in Regent&#x2019;s Park Road in North London, the slim brown-haired woman was showing a close interest in the display of tiles. &#x201c;Do you need some help?&#x201d; asked the young male assistant, who was keen to close since it was almost seven o&#x2019;clock in the evening.Liz Carlyle was killing time. In trainers and designer jeans, she looked like any of the wealthy young married women who drifted in and out of the interior-design shops and boutiques of this part of London. But Liz was neither wealthy nor married and she was certainly not drifting. She was very focused indeed. She was waiting for the device she held tightly in her left hand to vibrate once&#x2014;the signal that it was safe for her to proceed to the meeting in the coffee shop further down the road. In the mirror on the shop wall facing her, she could see Wally Woods, the leader of the A4 team providing counter- surveillance backup, taking his time buying an <i>Evening Standard</i> from the newsvendor on the corner.He had already sent the two pulses, which signalled that her contact, Marzipan, was inside the caf� waiting for her. Once his team further up the street on either side were satisfied that no one had followed Marzipan, Wally would send the okay.A young Asian man, dressed in black jeans and a hooded top, came along from the direction of Chalk Farm Underground Station. Wally and his team watched tensely as he paused to look in an estate agent&#x2019;s window. Moving on, he crossed over and left Regent&#x2019;s Park Road, walking off into the distance down a side street. Now the device in Liz&#x2019;s hand vibrated once. &#x201c;Thanks very much,&#x201d; said Liz to the relieved shop assistant. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring my husband in tomorrow evening and we&#x2019;ll decide then.&#x201d; She left the shop, turned right and walked quickly along the street to the coffee shop, which she entered without hesitating, all under the watchful eyes of the A4 team.Inside, Liz waited at the counter to order a cappuccino. She felt the familiar tension in her stomach, the quickened beating of her heart, which always accompanied work on the front line. She had missed this excitement. For the last four months or so, she had been on convalescent leave, following a counter-terrorist operation in Norfolk at the end of the previous year.She&#x2019;d gone down to her mother&#x2019;s house in Wiltshire almost immediately after the MI5 doctor had ordered her off work. In the ensuing weeks she&#x2019;d soon been well enough to help her mother in the garden centre she ran. On days off, they&#x2019;d visited National Trust houses and cooked elaborate dinners for two; occasionally, at the weekend they would socialise with friends from the neighbourhood. It had been pleasant, tranquil, and agonisingly uneventful. Now on this May evening she was happy to be back at the sharp end of operations.She had returned to work only that week. &#x201c;Take your time. Settle in,&#x201d; Charles Wetherby had told her, and back in her office in the counter-terrorism agent-running section she had started with the mountain of paperwork, which had accumulated in her absence. But then the message had come that afternoon from Marzipan&#x2014;code name for Sohail Din&#x2014;urgently requesting a meeting. Strictly speaking, Marzipan was no longer Liz&#x2019;s business. Her colleague Dave Armstrong had taken him over, along with the immense promise of reliable information that he represented, the minute she had left. But for the moment Dave was in Leeds on urgent business and Liz, as Marzipan&#x2019;s original recruiter and runner, had been the obvious choice to stand in.She took her coffee and walked to the gloomy back of the caf� where Marzipan was sitting at a small corner table, reading a book. &#x201c;Hello Sohail,&#x201d; she said quietly, sitting down.He closed his book and looked at her in surprise. &#x201c;Jane!&#x201d; he exclaimed, using the name he knew her by. &#x201c;I was not expecting you, but I am so happy to see you.&#x201d;She had forgotten how young he looked, but then, he <i>was</i> young. When Liz had first met Sohail Din, more than a year before, he had already been accepted to read Law at Durham University. He was still less than twenty. He had taken a job in his gap year at a small Islamic bookshop in Haringey. Though it was not well paid, he had hoped it would provide an opportunity for religious discussion with other serious-minded young men like himself. But he had soon found that the bookshop was a focal point for radical Islamist doctrine&#x2014;not at all the version of Islam that Sohail had learned at home and at his local mosque. He had been shocked by the casual talk of fatwas and jihad, then still more to find that some of his fellow employees openly supported the tactics of suicide bombers, even boasting of taking up arms themselves against the West. And finally he had come to realise that some of the people who came into the shop were actively involved in terrorist activities. That was when he had decided to act himself. He had found a police station some distance away and had told his story to a Special Branch officer. He was moved quickly through a well-tried route to MI5 and his first contact there, Liz Carlyle. She had recruited him and had developed him as a long-term agent, persuading him to put off his university career for a year. In the months that followed, Marzipan had provided invaluable information about the comings and goings of people of interest to MI5 and the police.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very good to see you again, Sohail,&#x201d; said Liz. &#x201c;You look well.&#x201d;Marzipan put down his book, saying nothing, but gazing at her gently, solemnly, his eyes large through his spectacles. Liz could see that he was on edge.&#x201c;Are you looking forward to university?&#x201d; she said, wanting to put him more at ease.&#x201c;Very much,&#x201d; he said earnestly.&#x201c;Good. You will do very well there, you know. And we are very grateful to you for delaying your studies.&#x201d; Gently, she made the transition to business. &#x201c;Your message said you needed to see us urgently. Has something happened?&#x201d;Now the young man&#x2014;not much more than a boy, thought Liz&#x2014;said, &#x201c;Two weeks ago, a man visited the bookshop. One of the boys in the shop told me he was an important Imam visiting from Pakistan, and I thought I recognised his face from one of the videos we sell in the shop. I told this to Simon. He said that if the man came back to the shop I should contact him immediately.&#x201d;Simon Willis was Dave Armstrong&#x2019;s working alias. Liz asked, &#x201c;And you&#x2019;ve seen this man again?&#x201d;Sohail Din nodded. &#x201c;This afternoon. He did not come into the shop. He was upstairs, with three other men. Young men, though one was older than the others. They were British Asians.&#x201d;&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;&#x201c;I am certain. I heard them speak. You see, I was sent upstairs to fix the video player. Aswan&#x2014;he works in the shop&#x2014;had installed it, but today is his day off. He had not connected it properly to the aerial.&#x201d;&#x201c;What were they watching?&#x201d;&#x201c;A video the Imam had brought&#x2014;there was a stack of them next to the VCR. They had one of these in the machine.&#x201d;The door to the caf� opened and Sohail peered over Liz&#x2019;s shoulder. But it was only two young women, laden with carrier bags, coming in for coffee after their shopping. Sohail continued, &#x201c;When I connected the recorder to the aerial I turned on the machine to make sure it was working properly. That&#x2019;s when I saw part of the video they were watching.&#x201d;He paused, and Liz suppressed her impatience and waited for him to resume. &#x201c;It was a video of this same man, the Imam. He was speaking in Urdu, which I do not understand well&#x2014;but from hearing it at home I know a little. He was saying that sometimes it was necessary to die for one&#x2019;s belief; he was talking about a holy war.&#x201d;She said, &#x201c;Did you see any more than that?&#x201d;Sohail shook his head. &#x201c;Not then. I didn&#x2019;t stay; I didn&#x2019;t want them to think I was paying much attention.&#x201d;&#x201c;Why do you think they were watching it? I mean, if the Imam was there anyway.&#x201d;Sohail paused for a moment. &#x201c;I have thought carefully about this. It came to my mind that he had come here to tutor the men. Maybe to prepare them.&#x201d;&#x201c;Prepare them?&#x201d;Sohail added quietly, &#x201c;I think he was preparing them for a mission. Perhaps a suicide mission. They talk about these things in the shop.&#x201d;Liz was surprised. This seemed a very dramatic conclusion. The Marzipan she had known had been calm and levelheaded; now he seemed frightened and overexcited. Liz asked calmly, &#x201c;Why do you think that?&#x201d;Suddenly Sohail reached down and brought a small paper bag out of his knapsack. He slid it across the table. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s why.&#x201d;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s in there?&#x201d; she asked.&#x201c;I brought the video. The Imam left it behind, along with the other tapes. I went upstairs and watched it just before we closed.&#x201d;Liz quickly put the video into her bag, pleased that Sohail had brought it, but also appalled by the risk he was taking. &#x201c;Well done, Sohail,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but won&#x2019;t they notice that it&#x2019;s gone?&#x201d;&#x201c;There were many other videos upstairs. And I am sure no one saw me go up there.&#x201d;&#x201c;It will have to go back quickly,&#x201d; she said firmly. &#x201c;But tell me first, these three men, how old were they?&#x201d;&#x201c;The young ones were about my age. The other one perhaps in his late twenties.&#x201d;&#x201c;You said they were British. Did you notice anything about their accents?&#x201d;&#x201c;It is difficult to say.&#x201d; He thought for a moment. &#x201c;Except the older one. I think he came from the North.&#x201d;&#x201c;Would you recognise them again?&#x201d;&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t be sure. I didn&#x2019;t want to look at them too carefully.&#x201d;&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; said Liz soothingly, for she could see that Sohail&#x2019;s eyes kept returning to the door. &#x201c;Do you have any idea where these three have gone to?&#x201d;&#x201c;No, but I know they&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201d;Liz felt her pulse pick up. &#x201c;Why? When?&#x201d;&#x201c;The same time next week. Aswan asked if he should bring the machine down. But the owner said not to bother, as it would be needed again on Thursday. That is why I think they are in training. There is a series of videos for them to watch. It is a sort of course they are doing.&#x201d;&#x201c;How do you know it will be the same men?&#x201d;Sohail thought for a moment. &#x201c;Because of the way he said it. &#x2018;Leave it,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;they&#x2019;ll need it again next week.&#x2019; The way he said &#x2018;they&#x2019;ll&#x2019; could only mean the same men.&#x201d;Liz considered this. They had some time, then, though not very much, to put an operation in place before the group reconvened. She thought hard for a moment, trying to decide what to do next. &#x201c;Tell me, could you meet me again later this evening? I&#x2019;d like to go and copy the video, and also collect some photographs for you to look at. Photographs of people. Can you do that?&#x201d;Sohail nodded.&#x201c;Let me tell you where to go.&#x201d; She gave him an address in one of the anonymous streets north of Oxford Street and made him repeat it back to her. Then she said, &#x201c;Take the Underground to Oxford Circus and walk west. Do you know where John Lewis is?&#x201d; Sohail nodded. &#x201c;So this is what you do to get to the house. We will make sure you aren&#x2019;t being followed, but if we are not happy, someone will stop you on the street and ask you for the time. They&#x2019;ll ask you twice&#x2014;and if that happens do not go to the safe house. Walk straight on, catch a bus and go home. And just in case you run into anyone you know, have an excuse ready for what you&#x2019;re doing there.&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s easy,&#x201d; said Sohail. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll say I&#x2019;ve been looking for CDs at the HMV shop on Oxford Street. They stay open late.&#x201d;Liz looked at her watch. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s now seven-thirty. I will meet you there at ten o&#x2019;clock.&#x201d;&#x201c;Will you be my contact again from now on?&#x201d; he asked.&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; she said mildly, for in truth she didn&#x2019;t know herself. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter, you know. We all work together.&#x201d;He nodded but there was a look in his eyes which Liz at first took for simple excitement, then realised was partly fear. She smiled reassuringly at him. &#x201c;You are doing a brilliant job. Just go on being very careful, Sohail.&#x201d;He smiled back at her a little bleakly, his eyes darkening. She added, &#x201c;If you ever feel you are in any danger, you must tell us at once. Use the alert procedure. We do not expect you to put yourself in unnecessary danger.&#x201d;She knew these were empty words. Of course he must be in jeopardy; in such operations risk was inevitable. Not for the first time, Liz questioned her participation in the subtle psychological game of agent running: cautioning the agent to be careful, acknowledging the danger he was in, reassuring him that he would be protected, encouraging him to obtain the information that was needed.

'God above, if you are there, you are most unkind to me. . . . Therefore, will I not serve you, will I not worship you, will I not obey you. Henceforth, I give of myself to those powers that most work against you, against your will and ways, and against your servants.' It was a prayer that invigorated me, made me feel emancipated from divine oppression and injustice, the master of myself and my fortunes, the bold possessor of new freedoms."<br><br>So begins the private war of one man determined to sell all for a convoluted allegiance, even at the cost of his own soul. Told from the perspective of a sworn lifelong enemy of John Calvin, this fast-paced biographical novel is a tale of envy that escalates to violent intrigue and shameless betrayal.</p><p><b>Douglas Bond</b> is the author of a number of books of historical fiction and biography.

While at the Detroit Printing Co-op, he radically rethought the possibilities of print by experimenting with overprinting, collage techniques, different kinds of papers and so on. Behind the calls to action and class consciousness written in his publications, there was an innate sense of the politics of design, experimentation and pride of craft. <br><br>Building on research conducted by Danielle Aubert, a Detroit-based designer, educator and coauthor of <i>Thanks for the view, Mr. Mies</i>, <i> The Politics of the Joy of Printing</i> explores the history, output and legacy of the Perlmans and the Co-op in a highly illustrated testament to the power of printing, publishing, design and distribution.</p></p><p>Danielle Aubert&#x2019;s history of the Detroit Printing Co-op offers a refreshing example of graphic design as it was practiced in the most alternative of ways&#x2015;not only outside of the mainstream design profession, but also against the prevailing capitalist economy premised on private ownership. For enthusiasts of graphic design, Fredy Perlman&#x2019;s unexpected visually inventive designs for politically salient works offer a much needed example of how self-publishing and DIY printing, so in vogue today, can be used to not just make something, but to also say something.

It is taken for granted that the Axis powers were defeated by an avalanche of munitions that poured forth from pitiless American factories. So it is amazing that the story of how this "miracle of production" was organized and integrated into Allied strategy and operations remains untold. <br><p><i>Keep from All Thoughtful Men</i> is the first book that tells how revolutions in both statistics and finance changed forever the nature of war. While the book relates the overall story of how economics dictated war planning at the highest levels, more specifically it tells how three obscure economists came to have more influence on the conduct of World War II than the Joint Chiefs. Because military historians rarely understand economics and economic historians just as rarely involve themselves with the details of war, there has never been a military history that shows how economics influenced the planning of strategy and the conduct of any war. This is sadly true of even World War II, which has been called by Paul Samuelson, "The Economist's War."</p></p><p>Jim Lacey, a retired U.S. Army Infantry officer with a Ph.D. from Leeds University in Great Britain, is a defense analyst and writer based in the Washington, DC area. He is the author of several books on military history, terrorism, and current affairs, including <i>Takedown: The 3rd Infantry Division's Twenty-One Day Assault on Baghdad</i> and a biography of General Pershing, among others.Much has been written about America s role in the Second World War and about the Second Front which was at the center of the story. Jim Lacey has turned the world upside down. Now for the first time we can see what really happened and why. This is a path-breaking book. --JOHN GOOCH, Emeritus Professor, University of Leeds, coauthor of <i>Military Misfortunes: The Anatomy of Failure in War</i><br><br>Jim Lacey tells how a few obscure American economists guided the miracle of production that crushed the Axis. In 1940-1943 all-outer military chiefs and Roosevelt himself badly misjudged American capacities of labor, materials and finance. Their jumbled arms programs were out of touch with reality. Lacey persuasively describes how the economists, applying then-new statistical measure like gross national product, convinced them to recalibrate output to credible goals that assured a timely victory. --EDWARD S. MILLER, author of <i>Bankrupting the Enemy: The U.S. Financial Siege of Japan Before Pearl Harbor</i><br><br>Quite simply Jim Lacey has overturned nearly 60 years of sloppy work by historians. This book represents a crucial contribution to our understanding of how the United States actually developed the mobilization plan that led to victory in the Second World War. It is undoubtedly one of the most important books to appear on the war in a decade. --WILLIAMSON MURRAY, author of <i>A War To Be Won: Fighting the Second World War</i><br><br><i>Keep From All Thoughtful Men</i> is a work of scholarship... Nonetheless, I was surprised to discover the book was not a daunting read. Readers interested in America s WWII home-front history may want a copy of Lacey s work for their shelves. Comparing some of its conclusions to much of what has been printed on the subject of America converting itself into the Arsenal of Democracy is useful. And what <i>Keep From All Thoughtful Men</i> adds to what we already know about America s weak military position in the first days of the war makes the story a little more hair-raising. --<b><i>America in WWII</i>, August 2011</b><br><br>Jim Lacey tells how a few obscure American economists guided the miracle of production that crushed the Axis.

Like most people born with cystic fibrosis, the chronic disease that affects primarily the lungs, Laura struggled to come to grips with a life that had already been compromised in many ways. Sometimes healthy and able to attend school, other times hospitalized for weeks, Laura found solace in keeping a diary. In her writing, she could be open, honest, and irreverent, like the young person she was. Yet behind this voice is a penetrating maturity about her mortality, revealing a will and temperament that is fierce and insightful.</p><p>It would be easy to assume that the story of Laura Rothenberg's battle with cystic fibrosis is one of a brave young woman staying constantly positive in the face of tremendous adversity. But situations such as hers are rarely that simple. Thankfully, the portrait that emerges in her memoir, <em>Breathing for a Living</em>, is that of a complex and very real human being who experiences joy, anger, despair, and hopefulness while struggling to live the kind of normal life most of her fellow college students take for granted. And while her candor is admirable, what makes Rothenberg a remarkable author is her dedication to just getting words written down on the page at times when many would simply retreat from the world. Through an agonized process of waiting for a lung transplant, she writes down exactly what she's feeling. She writes extensively as her body fights the disease and struggles to accept the new lungs. And as she is shuttled back and forth between her New York home, her academic career at Brown, and numerous emergency hospital stays, she keeps on writing. Diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at three days old, Rothenberg spent much of her life in and out of hospital rooms so her medical knowledge is extensive and well documented. One gets the impression that staying on top of this information helped her feel at least somewhat in control of her own situation and it lends a steady gravity to her emotionally charged memoir. The book is a pastiche of e-mails to friends, journal entries, and the occasional snapshot. It looks very much like a college kid's scrapbook, which, in many ways, it is. Rothenberg&#x2019;s energetic prose is highly informal and probably more guileless than one would see from a more seasoned writer. But that intimacy and simplicity adds to the charm and, as Rothenberg's health deteriorates, the heartbreak as well. By the end of <em>Breathing for a Living</em>, the reader loses a friend but gains a greater appreciation of what it means to live.<br>-<em>John Moe</em><strong>Laura Rothenberg</strong> was born and raised in New York City and attended the Chapin School and Brown University.

The child of emancipated slaves, he overcame the violent segregationism of Jim Crow, challenging white boxers--and white America--to become the first African-American heavyweight world champion. <i>The Big Smoke</i>, Adrian Matejka's third work of poetry, follows the fighter's journey from poverty to the most coveted title in sports through the multi-layered voices of Johnson and the white women he brazenly loved. Matejka's book is part historic reclamation and part interrogation of Johnson's complicated legacy, one that often misremembers the magnetic man behind the myth.</p><p><b>Adrian Matejka</b> is a graduate of the Southern Illinois University Carbondale MFA program.

In <i>Doctors Are More Harmful Than Germs</i>, Dr. Harvey Bigelsen explains how today&#x2019;s medical doctors overprescribe surgery and ignore its long-term health implications. Any invasive medical procedure, he argues&#x2014;including colonoscopies and root canals&#x2014;creates inflammation in the body, leading to serious and long-lasting health problems.<br><br>Inflammation, according to Dr. Bigelsen, is the real cause of all chronic disease (persistent or long-lasting illness). Noting that Western medicine has yet to &#x201c;cure&#x201d; a single chronic disease, Bigelsen points to a new paradigm: one that treats each patient as an individual (rather than as a set of symptoms), avoids further damage to the body through surgery, and looks for the root cause of chronic disease in past damage done to the patient&#x2019;s body&#x2014;whether caused by a bad fall or a scalpel. Provocatively written and radical in its approach, <i>Doctors Are More Harmful Than Germs</i> challenges readers to rethink everything they believe about illness and how to treat it.</p><p>Harvey Bigelsen, MD, helped found the American Holistic Medical Association (AHMA) in 1978, and three years later helped to write the Arizona law allowing alternative medical practitioners to be licensed and judged by their peers rather than by mainstream doctors. A frequent lecturer for alternative health organizations, he lives in Nevada City, CA. Medical writer Lisa Haller lives in St. Paul, MN.&#x201c;Bigelsen, a 30-year veteran of the medical industry and co-founder of the American Holistic Medical Association, sounds the alarm on the overwrought state of modern medicine. He argues that surgery often does more harm than good and few patients escape without lasting trauma, warning against trends like &#x2018;one-stop surgery,&#x2019; where doctors take care of many maladies with one procedure. The author rails against an overdependence on damaging antibiotics as a catch-all in treating the symptoms rather than eliminating the root cause of an ailment. Using statistics, charts and illustrations, Bigelsen justifies theories on disease transitions, the correlations between medicine and emotion and the perils of questionable preventative surgery, scar tissue and invasive dental procedures. The doctor advocates for more holistic and alternative approaches rather than traditional methods; he urges readers to trust their own bodies and their intrinsic intelligence rather than the opinions of medical doctors, who may or may not have the best intentions... the author elaborates with real-life medical cases and cites a number of media references and varying opinions from the medical and naturalist communities to substantiate his claims. Thankfully, his frequently pejorative thesis on 21st-century health care is combined with sensible advice stressing the importance and widespread availability of choices (second opinions) for anyone eager to weigh their options before &#x2018;blindly trusting&#x2019; in a health professional... Bigelsen contributes much-needed material to the ever-expanding canon of consumer-focused health literature.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;This small book is a gem, containing much more than a critique of the current American medical system. The cure of inflammation and disease resides in simple, non-toxic approaches that release tension, reduce inflammation, and allow self-regulation to cure.

Has all this changed, vanished, washed away forever in the light from yonder window?<br><br>What fantastic vision beyond the glass has taken a hallway filled with normal, wicked, face-breaking, neck-snapping humans and turned them into a clot of bland and drooling happy-wappys?<br><br>Unbelieving, I look again, and there it is. There it still is. Four neat rows of pink and brown, tiny wiggling creatures, so small and prunish and useless--and yet it is they who have turned this crowd of healthy, kill-crazy humans into a half-melted splotch of dribbling helplessness. And beyond this mighty feat of magic, even more absurd and dramatic and unbelievable, one of those tiny pink lumps has taken our Dark Dabbler, Dexter the Decidedly Dreadful, and made him, too, into a thing of quiet and contemplative chin spittle. And there it lies, waving its toes at the strip lights, utterly unaware of the miracle it has performed--unaware, indeed, even of the very toes it wiggles, for it is the absolute Avatar of Unaware--and yet, look what it has done in all its unthinking, unknowing wigglehood. Look at it there, the small, wet, sour-smelling marvel that has changed everything.<br><br>Lily Anne.<br><br>Three small and very ordinary syllables. Sounds with no real meaning--and yet strung together and attached to the tiny lump of flesh that squirms there on its pedestal, it has performed the mightiest of magical feats. It has turned Dexter Dead for Decades into something with a heart that beats and pumps true life, something that almost feels, that so very nearly resembles a human being--<br><br>There: It waves one small and mighty hand and that New Thing inside Dexter waves back. Something turns over and surges upward into the chest cavity, bounces off the ribs and attacks the facial muscles, which now spread into a spontaneous and unpracticed smile. Heavens above, was that really an emotion? Have I fallen so far, so fast?<br><br>Yes, apparently I have. There it goes again.<br><br>Lily Anne.<br><br>"Your first?" says a voice beside me, and I glance to my left--quickly, so as not to miss a single second of the spectacle on the far side of the window. A stocky Latin man stands there in jeans and a clean work shirt with Manny stitched over the pocket.<br><br>"Yes," I say, and he nods.<br><br>"I got three," he says, and smiles. "I don't get tired of it, either."<br><br>"No," I say, looking back at Lily Anne. "How could you?" She is moving her other hand now--and now both at the same time! What a remarkable child.<br><br>"Two boys," he says, shaking his head, and adds, "and at last, a girl." And I can tell from the tone of his voice that this thought makes him smile and I sneak another glance at him; sure enough, his face is stretched into an expression of happy pride that is nearly as stupid-looking as my own. "Boys can be so dumb," he says. "I really wanted a girl this time, and . . ." His smile stretches even wider and we stand together for several minutes in companionable silence, contemplating our bright and beautiful girls beyond the glass.<br><br>Lily Anne.<br><br>Lily Anne Morgan. Dexter's DNA, living and moving on through time to another generation, and more, into the far-flung future, a day beyond imagination--taking the very essence of all that is me and moving it forward past the clock-fingered reach of death, sprinting into tomorrow wrapped in Dexter's chromosomes--and looking very good doing it. Or so it seems to her loopy father.<br><br>Everything has changed. A world with Lily Anne Morgan in it is so completely unknown: prettier, cleaner, neater edges, brighter colors. Things taste better now, even the Snickers bar and cup of vending machine coffee, all I have had for twenty-four hours. The candy bar's flavor was far more subtle than I had known before, and the coffee tasted of hope. Poetry flows into my icy cold brain and trickles down to my fingertips, because all is new and wonderful now. And far beyond the taste of the coffee is the taste of life itself. Now it is something to nurture, protect, and delight in. And the thought comes from far out beyond bizarre that perhaps life is no longer something to feed on in the terrible dark frenzy of joy that has defined me until this new apocalyptic moment. Maybe Dexter's world should die now, and a new world of pink delight will spring from the ashes. And the old and terrible need to slash the sheep and scatter the bones, to spin through the wicked night like a thresher, to seed the moonlight with the tidy leftovers of Dexter's Dark Desiring? Maybe it's time to let it go, time to let it drain away until it is all gone, vanished utterly.<br><br>Lily Anne is here and I want to be different.<br><br>I want to be better than what I have been.<br><br>I want to hold her. I want to sit her on my lap and read her Christopher Robin and Dr. Seuss. I want to brush her hair and teach her about toothpaste and put Band-Aids on her knees. I want to hug her in the sunset in a room full of puppies while the band plays "Happy Birthday," and watch her grow up into wonderful beautiful cancer-curing symphony-writing adulthood, and to do that I cannot be who I have always been--and that is fine with me, because I realize one more important thing.<br><br>I don't want to be Dark Dexter anymore.<br><br>The thought is not so much a shock as a completion. I have lived my life moving in one direction and now I am there. I don't need to do those things anymore. No regrets, but no longer necessary. Now there is Lily Anne and she trumps all that other dancing in the dark. It is time to move on, time to evolve! Time to leave Old Devil Dexter behind in the dust. That part of me is complete, and now--<br><br>Now there is one small and very sour note singing in the choir of Dexter's happiness. Something is not quite right. Somewhere nearby some small gleam of the old wicked life flashes through the rosy glow of the new and a dry rattle of scales grates across the new melody.<br><br>Someone is watching me.<br><br>The thought comes as a silky whisper only one step removed from a chuckle. The Dark Passenger, as ever, is amused at the timing as well as the sentiment--but there is truth in the warning, too, and I turn very casual-careful, smile now stitched in place in the old fake way, and I scan the hallway behind me: first to the left, toward the vending machines. An old man, his shirt tucked into pants pulled much too high, leans against the soda machine with his eyes closed. A nurse walks by without seeing him.<br><br>I turn and look to the right, down to where the hallway ends in a "T" that goes one way to a row of rooms and the other way to the elevators. And there it is, as plain as a blip on any radar screen, or what is left of the blip, because someone is going around the corner toward the elevators, and all I can see is half his back as he scuttles away. Tan pants, a greenish plaid shirt, and the bottom of one athletic shoe, and he is gone, and he does not leave any explanation at all of why he was watching me, but I know that he was, and this is confirmed by the cheesy smirk I feel oozing from the Passenger, as if to say, Oh, really, we're leaving what behind?<br><br>I know of no reason in this world, or any other, why anyone would be interested in little old me. My conscience is as clean and empty as it can possibly be--which means, of course, that I have always tidied up carefully, and in any case, my conscience has the same hard reality as a unicorn.<br><br>But someone very definitely was watching me and this is oh-so-more-than-slightly bothersome, because I can think of no wholesome and happy reason why anyone would want to watch Dull-as-Dishwater Dexter, and I must now think that whatever threatens Dexter might also be a danger to Lily Anne--and this is not a thing that I can allow.<br><br>And of course the Passenger finds this highly amusing: that moments ago I was sniffing the bright buds of spring and forswearing the way of all flesh, and now I am once again up on point and eager to slay--but this is different. This is not recreational homicide. This is protecting Lily Anne, and even after these very first moments of life, I will quite happily rip the veins out of anything that comes near her, and it is with this comforting thought that I stroll to the corner of the hall and glance toward the elevator.<br><br>But there is nothing there. The hallway is empty.<br><br>...</p><h2>Think Smart: A Neuroscientist&#39;s Prescription for Improving Your Brain&#39;s Performance</h2><p><b> From a renowned neuroscientist and bestselling author comes a book that shows readers how to improve and tone the brain. </b><br><br> In the last five years, there have been exciting new scientific discoveries about the brain, its function, and its performance.

The end of World War II finally appears to be nearing. The Third Reich is collapsing in Europe, and the Americans are overpowering the once-mighty Japanese Empire in the Pacific. For a group of young pilots trained in the twilight of the war, their greatest worry is that it will end before they have a chance to face the enemy. <br><br>They call themselves Tail End Charlies: They fly at the tail end of formations, stand at the tail end of chow lines, and now they are catching the tail end of the war. What they don&#x2019;t know is that they will be key players in the bloodiest and most difficult of naval battles&#x2014;not only of World War II but in all of American history.<br><br><i>The Twilight Warriors</i> relives the drama of the world&#x2019;s last great naval campaign. From the cockpit of a Corsair fighter we gaze down at the Japanese task force racing to destroy the American amphibious force at Okinawa. Through the eyes of the men on the destroyers assigned to picket ship duty, we experience the terror as wave after wave of kamikazes crash into their ships. Standing on the deck of the legendary superbattleship <i>Yamato,</i> we watch Japan&#x2019;s last hope for victory die in a tableau of gunfire and explosions.<br><br>The fate of the Americans at Okinawa, including a twenty-two-year-old former art student, an intrepid fighter pilot whose life abruptly changes when his Corsair goes down off the enemy shore, and a young Texan lieutenant who volunteers for the most dangerous flying job in the fleet&#x2014;intercepting kamikazes at night over the blackened Pacific&#x2014;is intertwined with the lives of the &#x201c;young gods&#x201d;: the honor-bound kamikaes forces who swarm like killer bees toward the U.S. ships. <br><br>The ferocity of the Okinawa fighting stuns the world. Before it ends, the long battle will cost more American lives, ships, and aircraft than any naval engagement in U.S. history. More than simply the account of a historic battle, <i>The Twilight Warriors</i> brings to life the human side of an epic conflict. It is the story of young Americans at war in the air and on the sea&#x2014;and of their enigmatic, fanatically courageous enemy.</p><p>ROBERT GANDT is a former naval officer and aviator, international airline pilot, screenwriter, and a military and aviation historian. He is the author of several novels and non-fiction books, including <i>Bogeys and Bandits</i>, the definitive work on modern naval aviation, which was adapted for the television series <i>Pensacola: Wings of Gold</i>. He and his wife Anne live in the Spruce Creek Fly-In in Daytona Beach, Florida. Visit his web site at www.Gandt.com."Military historian and novelist Gandt (<i><i>Black Star Rising</i></i>, 2007, etc.) chronicles the epic Battle of Okinawa.<br><br>In the spring of 1945, as the Red Army approached Berlin, a ferocious land, sea and air battle raged in the Pacific, a dress rehearsal, many thought, for the upcoming invasion of Japan. The author credits the idea of bypassing the heavily fortified island of Formosa and seizing Okinawa to the brainy Adm. Raymond Spruance. Snapshots of Spruance, Marc Mitscher, Chester Nimitz, Ernest King, Morton Deyo and Arleigh Burke, towering names in American naval history, dot these pages, complemented by similar sharp takes on the Japanese high command defending the island. The heart of Gandt&#x2019;s story, though, is the tale of the young aviators, the Tail End Charlies on the American side, fearful they&#x2019;d never get into action, and the Japanese Thunder Gods, the kamikaze&nbsp;force whose suicide missions testified simultaneously to Japan&#x2019;s will and her desperation. By no means comprehensive&#x2014;Gandt checks in only periodically with the halting advance of Simon Buckner&#x2019;s 10th Army&#x2014;the narrative, nevertheless, consistently enlightens on numerous battle-related issues and incidents: the rivalry between the black shoe (seagoing) and the brown shoe (aviation) navy; how the Japanese consistently overestimated the destruction caused by the kamikaze&nbsp;missions; the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Buckner and famed correspondent Ernie Pyle; the peculiar susceptibility of the wooden-decked U.S. carriers to kamikaze&nbsp;attack; the sinking of the mighty battleship <i><i>Yamato</i></i>; the exploits of American ace Al Lerch, who shot down seven planes in a single mission; the strength of the USS&nbsp;<i><i>Laffey</i></i>, still afloat after six kamikaze&nbsp;crashes. The appalling price in lives lost, men wounded, ships sunk and aircraft destroyed made Okinawa &#x201c;the costliest naval engagement in U.S. history.&#x201d; Three months later the atomic bomb would fall on Hiroshima.<br><br>A fine popular account of history&#x2019;s last great sea battle."&nbsp; -- <i>Kirkus<br></i><br>&#x201c;Written &nbsp;in a wonderful bold style<i>,</i> with pathos, humor, tragedy, and gripping suspense, <i>Twilight Warriors</i> captures the life and death struggle of sailors and airmen fighting the last great Pacific battle of World War II... &nbsp;A riveting masterpiece, a powerful tribute to all those sailors and pilots who went in harm's way. &nbsp;Five stars!" --Stephen Coonts, author of <i>Flight of the Intruder<br></i><br>&#x201c;This extremely well written history of the Battle of Okinawa is unusual in that it is perfect for both beginning students and for experts. &nbsp;It is a book that will leave you with unforgettable memories of the heroes who fought&#x2014;on both sides&#x2014;in the Okinawan twilight.&#x201d;&nbsp; --Walter J. Boyne, former director of the National Air and Space Museum, author of <i>The Wild Blue</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Using the actual flying experience of the pilots of VBF-10 for center stage, Gandt broadens the scope of "The Twilight Warriors" by melding in Japanese air and sea operations with US operations to give us a complete view of the last big battle in the Pacific campaign. The detailed look at the personalities of American and Japanese warriors adds great insight into decisions made, both good and bad.

Working between the 1960s and early 1990s, the artists profiled in this compendium represent a broad cross section of L.A.'s art scene. With nearly 400 illustrations and ten essays, this volume presents histories of artistic experimentation and reveals networks of collaboration and exchange that resulted in some of the most intriguing art of late 20th-century America. From "mail art" to the rise of Chicano, gay, and feminist print media; the formation of alternative spaces to punk music and performance; fashion culture to the AIDS crisis&#x2014;the artists and works featured here comprise a boundary-pushing network of voices and talents.</p><p>C. Ondine Chavoya is Professor of Art History and Latina/o Studies at Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts</p><h2>God Is Love</h2><p>St. Teresa Margaret of the Sacred Heart was born into a large devout family in Arezzo, Italy in 1747. From the earliest days of her childhood, Anna Maria was filled with a deep love of God, questioning the adults around her as to 'Who is God'? <br>The cornerstone of St. Teresa Margaret's spirituality was to remain hidden, to appear just like everyone else in spite of her heroic virtue. To our loss, she has remained very much hidden even after her death. Fr. Gabriel of St. Mary Magdalen commented, 'This is an odd fact, for we do not hesitate to rank her among the primary figures who represent the glory of Carmel among Teresa of Jesus, John of the Cross, and Therese of the Child Jesus.'<br> Though St. Teresa Margaret led a life of exquisite holiness and purity, it was also a life that is wholly imitable. In her were combined Martha and Mary as she served her community as infirmarian while reaching the heights of contemplation. No one will come away from the pages of this book without his or her own spirit being renewed and reinvigorated. Already she was dissatisfied with answers given her. Only the contemplative life of a Carmelite nun could begin to quench her thirst to know and give herself completely to God. Her entire life was driven by the desire to 'return love for love.' She entered the Carmelite convent in Florence at the age of seventeen, advanced rapidly in holiness, and died an extraordinary death at twenty-two. Her spiritual director reflecting on her death remarked, 'She could not have lived very much longer, so great was the strength of the love of God in her.'</p><p></p><h2>1, 2 Chronicles (New American Commentary, 9) (Volume 9)</h2><p>THE NEW AMERICAN COMMENTARY is for the minister or Bible student who wants to understand and expound the Scriptures.

He has now written a replacement volume - powerful, personal, and practical - that reframes the whole issue for the new context of the twenty-first century. With great clarity Barndt traces the history of racism, especially in white America, revealing its various personal, institutional, and cultural forms. Without demonizing anyone or any race, he offers specific, positive ways in which people in all walks, including churches, can work to bring racism to an end. He includes the newest data on continuing conditions of People of Color, including their progress relative to the minimal standards of equality in housing, income and wealth, education, and health. He discusses current dimensions of race as they appear in controversies over 9/11, New Orleans, and undocumented workers. Includes analytical charts, definitions, bibliography, and exercises for readers.</p><p>Joseph Barndt has been a parish pastor and an antiracism trainer and organizer for 30 years, much of the latter work being done with Crossroads Ministry in Chicago, which he directed for 18 years.

The second World War is often seen as a confrontation of technology &#x2013; tanks and aircraft, artillery and engineering. But at the heart of the battlefield was the struggle between infantrymen, and the technology was there to enable them to capture ground or hold it. This second of two books on the organization and tactics of the German, US and British infantry in Europe focuses on national differences in the development of company and battalion tactics &#x2013; including those of motorized units &#x2013; and the confrontation and co-operation between infantry and tanks. Contemporary photos and diagrams and vivid colour plates illustrate what tactical theories actually meant on the ground at human scale.</p><p>An unrivalled illustrated reference source on fighting men and commanders, past and present.

The indie music world is littered with females who have not only withstood the racket of punk's intolerance, but have twisted our societal notions of femininity in knots.<br><br>Maria Raha focuses on the United States and England in the '70s and '80s, and illuminates how the influential women of this time shaped the female rockers of the '90s and today. Groups profiled range from the Runaways, the Avengers, and the Raincoats to L7, Sleater-Kinney, and Le Tigre, and include women who rarely get featured in "women in rock" titles, such as Exene Cervenka of X, Eve Libertine and Joy de Vivre of Crass, and Poison Ivy of the Cramps. The book features a complete discography and more than 25 photos.<br><br><i>Includes: Patti Smith, Exene Cervenka, Poison Ivy, Siouxsie Sioux, the Slits, Eve Libertine and Joy De Vivre, the Raincoats, Lydia Lunch, Wendy O. Williams, Kim Gordon, Kim Deal, Mia Zapata, Jenny Toomey, Hole, L7, Tribe 8, PJ Harvey, Bikini Kill, Sleater-Kinney, the Gossip, and many more</i><br></p><p><b>Maria Raha</b> works for <i>Spin</i> and <i>Vibe</i> magazines, and has written for <i>Time Out New York,</i> and <i>Bitch.</i> She lives in New York City.<br>From Patti Smith and the Runaways to newer stars, veteran rock scribe Raha introduces "the women . . . instrumental in shaping punk and indie underground music," members of "a community which proudly rejects the societal and cultural norms." Contending that "punk rock as a movement has changed the face of music forever," Raha dissects women's involvement in it, including the often-unwanted roles sex and appearance play in the perception of women in rock. The Runaways resembled the Monkees and the Sex Pistols, what with manager Kim Fowley calling the shots and band members chafing under them; Raha compares their career and those of the likes of L7, the Butchies, and Tribe 8, whose forthright lyrics and sonic assaults are more feminist than feminine. She shows that the Cramps' Poison Ivy is a mover and shaker in her own right, like such others as Exene Cervenka, Debbie Harry, and Wendy O.

But when she meets a new patient whose troubles mirror her own, she realizes she hasn&#x2019;t dealt with the pain of her recent past. After making a snap decision to get away for the summer, Sophia moves overseas to an apartment above a charming bookstore in Cornwall, England. She is hopeful she will find peace there surrounded by her favorite thing: great literature.&nbsp;</p><p>Bookstore owner Ginny Rose is desperate to save her business without asking for help from a husband who&#x2019;s decided to take a break from their marriage. Ginny never imagined she&#x2019;d be solely responsible for keeping afloat her husband&#x2019;s dream, but the unexpected friendship with her new renter has her feeling more optimistic. Between the two of them&#x2014;and Ginny&#x2019;s brother-in-law, William&#x2014;the bookstore might stand a chance.&nbsp;</p><p>Then Sophia finds a notebook in the bookstore that contains journal entries from Emily Fairfax, a governess who lived in Cornwall more than 150 years ago. Sophia learns that Emily harbored a secret passion for becoming an authoress&#x2014;as well as a deep love for her childhood friend, Edward, whose station she dared not dream to touch.&nbsp;</p><p>Eager to know more of Emily&#x2019;s story, Sophia goes on a quest&#x2014;dragging Ginny and William with her&#x2014;to discover the heart of the woman behind the beautiful entries.

It is a commonplace to note how the landless and scattered Jewish communities have, from the time of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 A.D. until the founding of modern Israel in 1948, cleaved to the text and derived their identity from it. But the story is far more complex. The shift from the Bible to the Torah, from biblical religion to rabbinic Judaism mediated by the Sages, and the sealing of the canon together with its continuing interpretive work demanded from the community, amount to what could be called an unparalleled obsession with textuality. Halbertal gives us insights into the history of this obsession, in a philosophically sophisticated yet straightforward narrative.</p><p><i>People of the Book</i> offers the best introduction available to Jewish hermeneutics, a book capable of conveying the importance of the tradition to a wide audience of both academic and general readers. Halbertal provides a panoramic survey of Jewish attitudes toward Scripture, provocatively organized around problems of normative and formative authority, with an emphasis on the changing status and functions of Mishnah, Talmud, and Kabbalah. With a gift for weaving complex issues of interpretation into his own plot, he animates ancient texts by assigning them roles in his own highly persuasive narrative.</p></p><p>Moshe Halbertal teaches Jewish Thought and Philosophy at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.Halbertal offers a sophisticated analysis of the development of Jewish text-centered cultures. His work is an important study for the history of interpretation within Judaism, though its significance as a model of how text-centered religions think extends even beyond Judaism...The work would make an excellent classroom introduction to the nature of the role that canonization plays in religions whose experience of the divine is mediated by the interpretation of sacred texts. This book is best suited to the philosophically sophisticated lay reader and to students or scholars of the sociology of religion. It should certainly be included among the holdings of all general, theological, and religious studies research libraries. (Robert H. O'Connell <i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>At once an introduction to Jewish hermeneutics, a reflection of canonicity, and a survey of Jewish politics of interpretation, this volume is lucidly composed and amply documented...This work is especially significant for its balanced and nuanced consideration of the "canonization of controversy" in Jewish thought. Particularly successful is Halbertal's use of his preferred expository device, the extended interpretation of selected controversies. Such closes analyses as, for example, those on R. Yair Bakhrakh and on the Maimonidean controversy are especially interesting. His probing review of philosophical and Kabbalistic challengers to Talmudism and his reflections on the Zionist turn from Talmud toward the Bible are careful and informative, yet also provocative. A desirable addition to undergraduate and graduate libraries. (Steven M.

This year they are showing traditional African- American quilts. But when one is stolen and it leads to a cold-blooded murder, Benni realizes there is more to this fair, and she&#39;ll have to see who is really a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing.</p><p><b>Earlene Fowler</b> was raised in La Puente, California, by a Southern mother and a Western father. She lives in Southern California with her husband, Allen, a large number of quilts, and twenty pairs of cowboy boots.Set in 1997, Fowler's folksy 14th Benni Harper mystery (after 2007's <i>Tumbling Blocks</i>) finds the avid quilter, museum curator, and reluctant sleuth readying herself for the annual San Celina (Calif.) County Mid-State Fair. Racial tensions revolving around the fair's first black general manager, Levi Clark; Levi's half-white daughter, Jazz; and Jazz's various suitors stir the plot. So, too, does the visit from Arkansas of Benni's great-aunt, Garnet Wilcox. Garnet and her sister, Dove, Benni's grandmother, get along like two bobcats trapped in a burning outhouse. A valued African-American quilt stolen from a fair exhibit and a corpse in another exhibit add fuel to the fire. Fowler's congenial mix of humor (prickly, surprising Garnet applies lessons learned from mystery books and cop shows), folklore (the history of black cloth dolls), and murder makes this Agatha Award&#x2013;winning series as much fun to visit as a county fair and a likely ribbon winner. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the pioneering book Black Portsmouth, Mark J. Sammons and Valerie Cunningham celebrate it, guiding the reader through more than three centuries of New England and Portsmouth social, political, economic, and cultural history as well as scores of personal and site-specific stories. Here, we meet such Africans as the "likely negro boys and girls from Gambia," who debarked at Portsmouth from a slave ship in 1758, and Prince Whipple, who fought in the American Revolution. We learn about their descendants, including the performer Richard Potter and John Tate of the People&#x2019;s Baptist Church, who overcame the tragedies and challenges of their ancestors&#x2019; enslavement and subsequent marginalization to build communities and families, found institutions, and contribute to their city, region, state, and nation in many capacities. Individual entries speak to broader issues&#x2014;the anti-slavery movement, American religion, and foodways, for example. We also learn about the extant historical sites important to Black Portsmouth&#x2014;including the surprise revelation of an African burial ground in October 2003&#x2014;as well as the extraordinary efforts being made to preserve remnants of the city&#x2019;s early Black heritage.</p><p>7 x 10 trim. 56 illus.<p>MARK J.

It is the single most comprehensive tool available for Christians seeking to understand Islam and reach Muslims with the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ. <br> Gary Corwin. Missioloigst, <i>SIM</i> and Associate Editor, <i>Evangelical Missions Quarterly</i><br> <br>Muslims and Islam are in the national and international news almost every day. Every Christian in the U.K. should know how to relate to Muslims and have a better understanding of their faith and life. If members of every congregation could engage with the well-tested programme of<i> Encountering the World of Islam</i>, they would help to equip and motivate the whole church to relate to Muslims with greater awareness and courage. <br> Colin Chapman, Author and Former Lecturer at <i>Near East School of Theology</i><br> <br>This is the most significant training tool of its kind that I have ever seen. All of us who love Muslims will want to study it and try to give the course and the book wider circulation. All of God's people need exposure to this great research and challenge. <br> George Verwer, Founder, <i>Operation Mobilization</i><br> <br>These days a multitude of stories need verification and many writers lack prolonged, personal contact with Muslims. It is both very gratifying and immeasurably vital to have the realism of practitioners brought to us by the text and course <i>Encountering the World of Islam</i>. No one seriously considering or already involved in ministry to Muslims should be without it.<br> Greg Livingstone, Co-Founder, <i>Frontiers</i><br> <br><i>Encountering the World of Islam</i> trains Christians and churches around the world to understand and relate to Muslim communities from the Middle East to Southeast Asia and European cities.

In one way or another in our world, we are already encountering the world of Islam. This carefully crafted collection of readings is designed to introduce you to Muslim peoples and history in a way that points toward a fulfillment of God's purpose for all peoples. It's really a designed re-encounter with Jesus. Somehow the light of hope seeps through every page and piece: Christ will indeed be loved and followed by many throughout the Muslim world. The surprise is that it's really not about you encountering Muslims. In light of this hope, you'll be able to envision the Muslim world encountering Jesus.<br> Steve Hawthrone, Co-Editor, <i>Perspectives of the World Christian Movement</i><br> <br>Given Christ's commissioned his church to disciple all the nations and given the massive number of Muslim peoples without the gospel today, Christ followers must take deliberate steps to reach them, but most churches don't know where to start. Whether God has already blessed your church with a burden to reach Muslims or He is awakening desire, this course is an absolute must.<br> Matthew Ellision, President, <i>Sixteen:Fifteen Church Missions Coaching</i><br> <br>We cannot recommend the <i>Encountering the World of Islam</i> course highly enough. Degree-level studies aside, it is probably the best course available on Islam in Britain and beyond, different aspects of various Muslim cultures, and how to build relationships with Muslims and possibly introduce them to Jesus. This study course explains as much as most Christians who live or work around Muslims should need to know. <br> Rev. Canon Phil Rawlings, <i>Church of England</i><br><br> The Lord of the Harvest is moving dramatically among many Islamic peoples. <i>Encountering the World of Islam</i> is a comprehensive and valuable resource for seasoned workers or those just trying to get beyond the stereotypes to achieve an informed engagement with Muslim people. You will never again see Muslims as anything less than people needing an introduction to a Savior who greatly loves them!<br> Jerry Trousdale, Director of International Ministries, <i>Cityteam Ministries</i>Keith Swartley has had a heart for Muslims since first befriending them in the old town of Mombasa, Kenya, East Africa in 1983. Since then Keith has enjoyed learning from and sharing with Muslims in the Republic of Georgia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Nigeria, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and the United States. One day he hopes to retire in the Muslim world, but until then Keith plans to continue motivating Christians to share the love of Christ reverently and gently with Muslims around the corner or across the globe.<br><br> Keith and his wife Ethel, a university professor teaching an English as a second language, have been married for 25 years and have two daughters: Margaret and Charis. In addition, their family has often included international students hosted for up to two years at a time.<br> <br>From 1993 until 2002, Keith was on staff with the <i>U.S. Center for World Mission</i> in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A focus of Keith's ministry since 1992 has been the development of <i>Encountering the World of Islam</i>. After September 11, 2001, the course became his main ministry focus. In the summer of 2002, the Swartleys joined <i>Caleb Project</i> in Littleton, Colorado, to further develop Encountering the World of Islam, which subsequently came under the ministry of Pioneers in 2007.<br> <br>For the last 20 years, the EWI course has trained over 15,000 participants to express the love of Christ and to plant reproducing churches among Muslims. <i>Encountering the World of Islam</i> has been translated into Chinese, Korean, Russian, Portuguese, and Spanish empowering Christians to love and effectively share the hope of the gospel with Muslims in over twenty countries.</p><h2>Forest Cats of North America</h2><p><p> <i>Superb pictorial of big cats.</i> </p><p> Big cats are efficient predators that once roamed from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico. Today, they are confined to scattered, remote habitats. </p><p> <b>Forest Cats of North America</b> is an intensive look at panthers, cougars, lynxes and bobcats, describing each species in detail. Range maps identify where the cats live and fact files feature scientific and common names, number of subspecies, physical traits, diet, life span and more. Spectacular color photographs capture these cats as they stalk, hunt and raise their young. </p><p> The fascinating evolution of big cats is covered including the differences between North American and African cats and how the cougar may well be the ancestor of the cheetah. </p><p> <b>Forest Cats of North America</b> is a lively, informative introduction to the continent's most elusive predators. </p></p><p><p> <b>Jerry Kobalenko</b> has logged 4,000 miles on foot over the course of twenty-five wildlife expeditions. His writing and photography appear around the world in such publications as <i>Outside</i>, <i>National Geographic</i>, <i>Adventure</i> and <i>Cond� Nast Traveler</i>. He lives in Banff, Alberta. </p><p> Wildlife photographers <b>Thomas Kitchin</b> and <b>Victoria Hurst</b> live in Nova Scotia. Their work has appeared in nature, news and general-interest publications including <i>Field and Stream</i>, <i>National Wildlife</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>Reader's Digest</i> and <i>Time</i>. </p>Cougars, bobcats, and lynx are "ghosts" rarely seen even by those who venture into the wilderness. This well-written book offers a good introduction to the lives of these three predators. In short, easily read sections, the author compares and contrasts the behavior and lifestyles of each species. Hunting methods and prey species chosen are covered, as well as courtship and cub rearing, territoriality, and interactions with humans. A nice feature is a boxed "Basics" section about each cat, giving vital statistics, such as length and weight, diet, litter size, and North American population estimates. Range maps are provided, along with a useful sidebar on the running and jumping abilities of each species--information that can be surprisingly hard to find! Illustrated with stunning photographs that not only illuminate the text but also further reveal details of behavior--one great image is of a fight between a bobcat and a lynx--this book will be a very good initiation to the world of North American cats. <i>Nancy Bent</i></p><h2>The Adderall Diaries: A Memoir</h2><p><p>In this groundbreaking memoir, Stephen Elliott pursues parallel investigations: a gripping account of a notorious San Francisco murder trial, and an electric exploration of the self. Destined to be a classic, <i>The Adderall Diaries </i>was described by <i>The Washington Post </i>as "a serious literary work designed to make you see the world as you've never quite seen it before."</p></p><p><p><b>Stephen Elliott</b> is the author of seven books, including <i>Happy Baby</i>, a finalist for the New York Public Library's Young Lions Award. He is also the founding editor of the online culture magazine TheRumpus.net.</p>As a writer stymied by past success, writers block, substance abuse, relationship problems and a serious set of father issues, Elliott's cracked-out chronicle of a bizarre murder trial amounts to less than the sum of its parts. Not long into the 2007 trial of programmer Hans Reiser, accused of murdering his wife, the defendant's friend Sean Sturgeon obliquely confessed to several murders (though not the murder of Reiser's wife). Elliott, caught up in the film-ready twist and his tenuous connection to Sturgeon (they share a BDSM social circle), makes a gonzo record of the proceedings. The result is a scattered, self-indulgent romp through the mind of a depressive narcissist obsessed with his insecurities and childhood traumas. Elliott is an undeniably good writer, but his voice has more to do with amphetamines than the author himself or the trial at hand. Elliott's frustration with himself is contagious; any readers expecting a true crime will be bewildered, and those familiar with Elliott (My Girlfriend Comes to the City and Beats Me Up) will find more (or less) of the same. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Beginning with the traditional core of pastoral care as a critical function of the church pastor, McMickle expands that core into a second circle of care&#x2014;as the pastor equips and empowers church members to participate in caring for one another. Finally, McMickle throws open the doors of the church and challenges pastors, lay leaders, and church members alike to extend their ministries of pastoral care to the local community, through ministries of:<br>�Advocacy <br>�Justice <br>�Healthcare <br>�Education <br>�Service<br> <br>A richly reflective and utterly practical resource, this volume deepens the church&#x2019;s understanding of pastoral care&#x2014;and expands that compassionate and priestly ministry in the church and in the world.</p></p><p><p>Marvin A.

Beginning with the 1558 founding of South America&#x2019;s first convent, Burns shows that nuns in Cuzco played a vital part in subjugating Incas, creating a creole elite, and reproducing an Andean colonial order in which economic and spiritual interests were inextricably fused. <br> Based on unprecedented archival research, <i>Colonial Habits </i>demonstrates how nuns became leading guarantors of their city&#x2019;s social order by making loans, managing property, containing &#x201c;unruly&#x201d; women, and raising girls. Coining the phrase &#x201c;spiritual economy&#x201d; to analyze the intricate investments and relationships that enabled Cuzco&#x2019;s convents and their backers to thrive, Burns explains how, by the late 1700s, this economy had faltered badly, making convents an emblem of decay and a focal point for intense criticism of a failing colonial regime. By the nineteenth century, the nuns had retreated from their previous roles, marginalized in the construction of a new republican order.<br> Providing insight that can be extended well outside the Andes to the relationships articulated by convents across much of Europe, the Americas, and beyond, <i>Colonial Habits</i> will engage those interested in early modern economics, Latin American studies, women in religion, and the history of gender, class, and race.<br></p><p>Burns&#39;s important and highly readable work takes a fresh look at the key economic, social, and cultural relationships that created and sustained a densely woven urban-centered colonial society in the Andes. Among its new findings: at the heart of the economy of colonial Cuzco, a credit institution run by women favored the conquered indigenous elite with long-term finance at concessionary interest rates.&#34;--John Coatsworth, Harvard University<p>Kathryn Burns is Associate Professor of History at the University of North Carolina,Chapel Hill.</p></p><h2>Cimarron: Freedom and Masquerade</h2><p><p><strong>This series of extraordinary photographic portraits by Charles Fr�ger brings to life the vivid costumes used in festivals by the descendants of African slaves in America.</strong></p><p>All across the Americas, from the sixteenth century onwards, enslaved Africans escaped their captors and struck out on their own. These runaways established their own communities or joined with indigenous peoples to forge new identities. <em>Cimarr�n</em>, borrowing a Spanish-American term for these fugitive former slaves, is a new series of photographic portraits of their descendants by acclaimed photographer Charles Fr�ger, whose work is defining a new genre of documentary photography. From Brazil, Colombia, the Caribbean islands, Central America, and as far as the southern United States, elaborate masquerades are staged that celebrate and keep alive the history and memory of African slaves and their creole or mixed-race descendants.</p><p>Unique photographs of people in dynamic costumes from remote regions of the world will enthrall followers of social history, ethnic folklore, and unusual fashion experimentation. Vividly colored silks and cottons combine with woven fibers, leaves, feathers, and body paint; props include emblems of slavery and slave masters&#x2015; ropes, sticks, guns, and machetes. These photographs, supplemented with texts by specialists in social anthropology to provide ethnographic and historical context, record real people whose collective sense of memory, folk history, and imagination dramatically challenge our expectations.</p> 200 color illustrations</p><p><strong>Charles Fr�ger</strong> is a photographer based in Rouen, France.

Now Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry Truman and an acclaimed novelist and biographer in her own right, explores the fascinating position of First Lady throughout history and up to the present day.<br><br>With her unique perspective as the daughter of a First Lady, Ms. Truman reveals the truth behind some of the most misunderstood and forgotten First Ladies of our history, as well as the most famous and beloved. In recounting the charm and courage of Dolley Madison, the brazen ambition of Florence Harding, the calm, good sense of Grace Coolidge, the genius of Eleanor Roosevelt, the mysterious femininity of Jackie Kennedy, and the fierce protectiveness of Nancy Reagan, among others, Margaret Truman has assembled an honest yet affectionate portrait of our nation&#x2019;s First Ladies&#x2014;one that freely acknowledges their virtues and their flaws.</p><p><b>Margaret Truman</b> won faithful readers with her works of biography and fiction, particularly her ongoing series of Capital Crimes mysteries. Her novels let us into the corridors of power and privilege, and poverty and pageantry, in the nation&#x2019;s capital. She was the author of many nonfiction books, including <i>The President&#x2019;s House,</i> in which she shares some of the secrets and history of the White House where she once resided. Truman lived in Manhattan and passed away in 2008.Chapter 1<br> &#x2014;<br> THE WORLD&#x2019;S SECOND TOUGHEST JOB<br> &nbsp;<br> A few months after Bill and Hillary Clinton settled into the White House, they invited me and my husband, Clifton Daniel, down from New York to have dinner and stay overnight with them. I said we were perfectly willing to stay in a hotel. We did not want to intrude on the rare hours of relaxation a President and First Lady have in their hectic lives. &#x201c;Nonsense,&#x201d; Hillary replied in her direct way. &#x201c;We like to have company.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was one of my most pleasant nights in that historic house, where my mother and father spent eight tumultuous years and where I alternated between being full-time and part-time boarder. We slept in the Queens&#x2019; Bedroom, with its majestic canopied bed, rose-tinted walls, and graceful eighteenth-century couches and chairs. A procession of reigning queens have stayed there, as well as Prime Minister Churchill and other heads of state. Its present elegance is light-years away from the run-down White House the Trumans inherited in the spring of 1945. I remember crying myself to sleep on my first night in the place, it all looked so shabby and second rate. A cadre of creative First Ladies, starting with Jacqueline Kennedy, are responsible for this transformation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Occasionally, when the pressure got to him, my father used to call the mansion &#x201c;The Big White Jail.&#x201d; I was amused to hear that Bill Clinton shares this salty sentiment. At one point during our evening of fine food and lively talk, he wryly suggested the place should be a line item in the budget as part of the federal penitentiary system.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hillary smiled agreement at this presidential grousing, as Bess Truman had in her now distant days. This is the perfectly normal reaction of any two human beings who find themselves in what someone has called &#x201c;eighteen acres under glass.&#x201d; It does not imply any lack of affection for the President&#x2019;s house. In fact, as we talked past midnight, I could see that Bill Clinton&#x2019;s fascination with the history of the place equaled Harry Truman&#x2019;s.<br> &nbsp;<br> Living in the White House is a unique experience&#x2014;a fantastic compound of excitement and tension and terror and pride and humility. Above all it is a historic experience. The spirit of the past is everywhere, reminding you of other men and women who have walked the corridors at midnight and morning, pondering&#x2014;or regretting&#x2014;large decisions.<br> &nbsp;<br> But a President is also constantly reminded of his powers. I will never forget my awe, the first time I saw my mother and father descend the wide, red-carpeted grand staircase to lead their honored guests into the lofty State Dining Room. Dad always looked his best in white tie and tails. In an evening gown, Mother looked marvelously regal. The red-coated Marine Band blared &#x201c;Hail to the Chief,&#x201d; the stirring march from an old London musical which was selected to enhance the presidential presence by one of our most politically astute First Ladies, Sarah Polk.<br> &nbsp;<br> You will note, however, that the march hails only the President. In the Constitution, he is designated the chief executive officer of the nation and commander in chief of the armed forces. In the West Wing of the White House, he presides over a staff of dozens of loyal followers in a web of offices surrounding his oval sanctum. About the First Lady, on the other hand, the Constitution is silent. No trumpets blare when she enters the State Dining Room or any other room, unless she is with the President. In my mother&#x2019;s day, fifty years ago, the President&#x2019;s wife could count her staff on the fingers of one hand. A few decades earlier, a First Lady had no staff to count. The male politicians who put together the federal government seem never to have given a thought to what a First Lady might do, thereby encouraging Congress to pretend, until recently, that she did not exist when they voted a budget for the White House.<br> &nbsp;<br> These days, as Hillary Rodham Clinton and other modern presidential wives have amply demonstrated, First Ladies are doing a lot. But the job remains undefined, frequently misunderstood, and subject to political attacks far nastier in some ways than those any President has ever faced. It has complications as mind-boggling from a psychological or political point of view as the conundrums faced by the double-domes in the State Department or the Pentagon.<br> &nbsp;<br> For one thing, almost all the people in Washington, D.C., are there because they want to be at the white-hot center of power. The ones with the most power, members of Congress and the President, have the added assurance that the American people have sent them there. That is particularly true of the President, the one politician who is elected by the vote of the entire nation. Few if any Presidents, including my father, did not want that unique job. Most of them have been like Bill Clinton; they have hungered and hankered for it most of their lives. Abraham Lincoln may have put it best when he said: &#x201c;No man knows what that gnawing is until he has had it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> On the other hand, a First Lady, as Lady Bird Johnson has noted in her gentle southern way, has been chosen by only one man&#x2014;the President&#x2014;and it is highly unlikely that he was thinking about her as First Lady when he proposed. No matter how different our First Ladies have been&#x2014;and as individual women they have ranged from recluses to vibrant hostesses to political manipulators on a par with Machiavelli&#x2014;they have all shared the unnerving experience of facing a job they did not choose. With few exceptions, they have also shared a determination to meet its multiple challenges.<br> &nbsp;<br> Each of them has done the job differently&#x2014;yet few of them have been openly critical of their predecessors (unlike Presidents, who tend to be ferociously judgmental of those who have preceded or followed them into the Oval Office). Instead, First Ladies have, to a startling degree considering the acrimonious political world they inhabit, reached out to one another. Many have even become friends.<br> &nbsp;<br> By a somewhat eerie coincidence, I was in Austin, Texas, interviewing Lady Bird Johnson for this book on the night Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died. We were having drinks on the deck of Mrs. Johnson&#x2019;s lovely home, overlooking the winding Colorado River, when one of her Secret Service men reported they had just received word that Mrs. Onassis would probably not live past midnight. Deeply moved, Lady Bird spoke in almost biblical cadences about how much she had come to love and admire Jackie for her bravery, her grace, her generosity of spirit. She talked of how magically Jackie had captured our hearts in those thousand days of soaring hope that distinguished John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s administration. She discoursed even more eloquently on how Jackie&#x2019;s courage had held the Kennedy family and the nation together during a time of almost unbearable tragedy.<br> &nbsp;<br> A few days after the Trumans moved into the White House in 1945, my mother received one of the nicest letters of her life from Grace Coolidge. It was full of understanding and encouragement from someone who could really empathize with her situation. Grace&#x2019;s husband, Calvin Coolidge, had been vice president when he was awakened at 2:30 A.M. on August 2, 1923, to be informed that his President, Warren Harding, was dead and Coolidge was now the Chief Executive and his wife the First Lady.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Coolidge asked Mother &#x201c;to accept from one who has passed through a similar experience the heartfelt expression of best wishes.&#x201d; She hoped Mother and Dad would be given three essentials for survival in the White House, &#x201c;strength, good courage and abounding health.&#x201d; It meant a lot to Mother, to know there was another woman out there who had been through it all and was rooting for her&#x2014;even if she was a Republican!<br> &nbsp;<br> When Ronald Reagan was seriously wounded by a would-be assassin in 1981, Nancy Reagan received a deeply compassionate letter from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who knew, better than any living former First Lady, the terror and grief and anguish such an experience evokes. Later, Jackie followed up the letter with a phone call. Nancy never forgot this spontaneous sympathy and expressed her enduring gratitude for it when Jackie died of cancer in 1994.<br> &nbsp;<br> Along with friendship, many First Ladies have found a common bond with some of their predecessors who, on the surface at least, seem to have had drastically different styles. Hillary Clinton amazed me when she said Bess Truman was one of the First Ladies she most admired. I could not imagine two more different women. My mother would have required two divisions of Marines to drag her before a congressional committee to testify on health care or anything else.<br> &nbsp;<br> But when Hillary began talking about the depth and intensity of Bess Truman&#x2019;s behind-the-scenes political partnership with my father, I understood immediately. That kind of partnership has been the bedrock of Hillary&#x2019;s relationship with Bill Clinton. In Hillary&#x2019;s case it has been a publicly declared fact. In Bess Truman&#x2019;s case it was a closely held secret. But for Hillary, the partnership was the important thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was reminded of an almost as startling discovery about another First Lady: years ago a mutual friend told me Jacqueline Kennedy often said my mother was the First Lady she most admired. Then, too, I had to stifle my impulse to blink in disbelief. Jackie Kennedy, the quintessence of New York and Paris chic, admiring Bess Truman, with her sensible suits and flowered hats? Jackie, the woman who gave serious art and high culture a major niche in American consciousness, admiring down-to-earth Bess Truman, whose favorite reading was detective stories?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What she admired,&#x201d; the friend said, &#x201c;is the way your mother defended her privacy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I nodded, much as I was to do later with Hillary Rodham Clinton, and thought: of course. A gentle, enormously sensitive woman like Jackie would understandably want to escape much of the pitiless public gaze and the occasional public frenzies that are an inevitable part of the First Lady&#x2019;s job.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was another reason Jackie admired my mother, the friend said. &#x201c;She brought a daughter to the White House at a very impressionable age and managed to get her through eight years without being spoiled.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I am not sure my mother (or my husband) would completely agree with that compliment. But, again, I felt an instant sympathy as I recalled Jackie&#x2019;s desire to raise Caroline and John in the White House without the distorting glare of publicity. She had learned that the American people tend to feel the First Family is public property, like the White House itself.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hillary Clinton told me she did not discover this troublesome tendency until she and Bill enrolled their daughter, Chelsea, in the Sidwell Friends School. Suddenly they were under fire in a half dozen newspapers and on television for choosing a private rather than a public school.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Ecosystems of Florida</h2><p>"An important book that everyone who works on Florida environmental policy in any way should own . . .

The white authorities ruled the death a suicide, but many members of the African American community believed that Hunt had been murdered&#x2015;a sentiment that sparked rebellions and protests across the city. Cairo suddenly emerged as an important battleground for black survival in America and became a focus for many civil rights groups, including the NAACP. The United Front, a black power organization founded and led by Reverend Charles Koen, also mobilized&#x2015;thanks in large part to the support of local Christian congregations.<br><i><br></i>In this vital reassessment of the impact of religion on the black power movement<i>,</i> Kerry Pimblott presents a nuanced discussion of the ways in which black churches supported and shaped the United Front. She deftly challenges conventional narratives of the de-Christianization of the movement, revealing that Cairoites embraced both old-time religion and revolutionary thought. Not only did the faithful fund the mass direct-action strategies of the United Front, but activists also engaged the literature on black theology, invited theologians to speak at their rallies, and sent potential leaders to train at seminaries. Pimblott also investigates the impact of female leaders on the organization and their influence on young activists, offering new perspectives on the hypermasculine image of black power.<br><br>Based on extensive primary research, this groundbreaking book contributes to and complicates the history of the black freedom struggle in America. It not only adds a new element to the study of African American religion but also illuminates the relationship between black churches and black politics during this tumultuous era.</p><p><b>Kerry L. Pimblott </b>is lecturer in American history at the University of Manchester."By attending so carefully to the social history of Cairo, the author forces a reconsideration of older arguments about the relationship of religion, civil rights, and black power, that have grown stale and usually depend on the statements of national figures such as King, Stokely Carmichael, and so forth. What we get here is an intensive on-the-ground examination of how religion and the rhetoric and practice of black power actually operated in a local community that had a very particular history, and one that did not look like the Deep South familiar from the civil rights movement."&#x2015;Paul Harvey, Professor of History, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs<p>"Pimblott's <i>Faith in Black Power </i>offers a new and unique interpretation of the relationship between the Black church and the Black power years of the Civil Rights Movement. Rooted in an enormous amount of newly discovered primary sources, this path-breaking book contributes greatly to our understanding of the second phase of the African American led Freedom struggle."&#x2015;<i>Journal of Pan African Studies</i></p><p>"Pimblott's ability to connect the dynamics of Cairo, Illinois, and the United Front to larger national histories of civil rights and social justice are quite commendable.

It is a book about dying people and about a dying England, clinging to its memories of greatness as it succumbs to terminal decay.&nbsp;<br><br> Everyone wants a comfortable place to die, and Kingsley Amis&#x2019;s characters have found it in Tuppeny-happeny Cottage, where assorted septuagenarians have come together to see one another out the door of life.

Born in suburban South London, the only child of a clerk in the office of the mustard-maker Colman&#x2019;s, he went to the City of London School on the Thames before winning an English scholarship to St. John&#x2019;s College, Oxford, where he began a lifelong friendship with fellow student Philip Larkin. Following service in the British Army&#x2019;s Royal Corps of Signals during World War II, he completed his degree and joined the faculty at the University College of Swansea in Wales. <i>Lucky Jim</i>, his first novel, appeared in 1954 to great acclaim and won a Somerset Maugham Award. Amis spent a year as a visiting fellow in the creative writing department of Princeton University and in 1961 became a fellow at Peterhouse College, Cambridge, but resigned the position two years later, lamenting the incompatibility of writing and teaching (&#x201c;I found myself fit for nothing much more exacting than playing the gramophone after three supervisions a day&#x201d;). Ultimately he published twenty-four novels, including science fiction and a James Bond sequel; more than a dozen collections of poetry, short stories, and literary criticism; restaurant reviews and three books about drinking; political pamphlets and a memoir; and more. Amis received the Booker Prize for his novel <i>The Old Devils</i> in 1986 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990. He had three children, among them the novelist Martin Amis, with his first wife, Hilary Anne Bardwell, from whom he was divorced in 1965. After his second, eighteen-year marriage to the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard ended in 1983, he lived in a London house with his first wife and her third husband.<br><br><b> Craig Brown</b> is the author of <i>Hello Goodbye Hello</i>, <i>The Lost Diaries</i>, and <i>The Marsh-Marlowe Letters</i>.

Nice people, it is felt, do not talk about it, and they certainly do not look at images representing the atrocity.</p><p>In <i>Imagery of Lynching</i>, Dora Apel contests this adopted stance of ignorance. Through a careful and compelling analysis of over one hundred representations of lynching, she shows how the visual documentation of such crimes can be a central vehicle for both constructing and challenging racial hierarchies. She examines how lynching was often orchestrated explicitly for the camera and how these images circulated on postcards, but also how they eventually were appropriated by antilynching forces and artists from the 1930s to the present. She further investigates how photographs were used to construct ideologies of "whiteness" and "blackness," the role that gender played in these visual representations, and how interracial desire became part of the imagery.</p><p>Offering the fullest and most systematic discussion of the depiction of lynching in diverse visual forms, this book addresses questions about race, class, gender, and dissent in the shaping of American society. Although we may want to avert our gaze, Apel holds it with her sophisticated interpretations of traumatic images and the uses to which they have been put.</p></p><p>Dora Apel is the W. Hawkins Ferry Chair in Modern and Contemporary Art at Wayne State University. She is the author of Memory Effects: The Holocaust and the Art of Secondary Witnessing.&#34;This book makes a major contribution to the scholarship on both lynching and the artistic representation of racism in the United States. It will undoubtedly be a foundational work for subsequent research by historians and art historians alike.&#34;</p><h2>Poles in Wisconsin (People of Wisconsin)</h2><p><p>In this all-new addition to the People of Wisconsin series, author Susan Mikos traces the history of Polish immigrants as they settled in America&#x2019;s northern heartland.

In each locale, they brought with them a hunger to own land, a willingness to work hard, and a passion for building churches.</p><p>Included is a first person memoir from Polish immigrant Maciej Wojda, translated for the first time into English, and historical photographs of Polish settlements around our state.</p></p><p><p><b>Susan Gibson Mikos</b> is a historic preservation consultant who lives in Shorewood, Wisconsin.

Oseary, who is also Madonna's manager and has worked with her for the past twenty years, traveled with the artist and was given unprecedented access to each performance. As a result, the photographs in <i><b>Madonna Confessions</b></i> capture the essence, sheer energy, and excitement that came alive onstage every night.

That&#39;s what Howard&#39;s mother tells him. There is no such thing as a boy, and certainly no such thing as a boy on top of a bed. That&#39;s what Monster&#39;s mother tells him. But no matter what their mothers say, Howard and Monster remain afraid of the dark. Then one spooky night Howard and Monster come face-to-face with each other. Jackie French Koller and Betsy Lewin have created a &#34;monster-under-the-bed&#34; story that offers the perfect cure for fear of the dark.</p><p><b>Jackie French Koller </b>is the author of more than a dozen books for children, including the Mole &amp; Shrew picture books. She lives in Westfield,&nbsp;Massachusetts.<br><br><b>Betsy Lewin </b>has illustrated many books for children, including <i>A&nbsp;Thousand Cousins </i>by David L. Harrison, and <i>Booby Hatch, </i>a 1995 <i>School Library Journal </i>Best Book of the Year, which she wrote. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.Monsters, according to popular opinion, live under beds. Koller (the Mole and Shrew books), rather than deny these beasts' existence, questions their frightful intentions. In this mildly suspenseful tale, a boy named Howard tells his mother, "I heard [a monster] snurkling under my bed." Meanwhile, a young monster informs his mother that he hears a boy "sneezing on top of my bed." Left alone by their disbelieving parents, human and monster peek at each other and shriek in fear; only when their terror turns to tears do they dare a second, curious look. On the closing page, they trade places for a practical joke that's left to the reader's imagination: " 'Oh, Mommy,' they both called together. 'Mommy, come quick!' " Lewin (Somebody Catch My Homework) draws in loose, Quentin Blake-style gestures of pen and ink, and fills the negative space with watercolor washes of dusky blue and brown. She envisions Monster (who reads a scary comic titled Boy) as a warty green gargoyle with clawed toes, a boar's snout and tusks. Koller invents a monster vocabulary: Monster "whimples" when Howard whimpers, and "sniggles" when his friend giggles. The plot is predictable and even a bit shopworn, yet the energetic telling and agreeable illustrations could put some fears temporarily to rest.

She swore she&#x2019;d never do it, but she was late for a career-saving meeting at Schwartz and Associates and her options were limited. If she&#x2019;d faked it five minutes sooner, she might have earned her father&#x2019;s approval, won the account, and bested her rival and the company golden boy, Ross Morgan. <br> <br>Calm, cool, and always collected, Ross is the perfect person to take over the ad agency her father founded&#x2013;and the perfect opposite of Shelley, who&#x2019;s distracted by her mother&#x2019;s relentless matchmaking and her big sister&#x2019;s marital meltdown. Is it any wonder her father has entrusted the agency to the blond, Porsche-driving Ross rather than his own flesh and blood? To add insult to injury, Ross&#x2013;her new boss&#x2013;has stuck Shelley with the client list from hell (Falafel Hut, anyone?). But if he thinks he&#x2019;s going to chase Shelley Schwartz out of her family legacy, he&#x2019;s got another thing coming. And if Shelley thinks she can resist Ross&#x2019;s charms, she&#x2019;s got some surprises in store as well.</p><p>Wendy Wax began her broadcast career at a tiny radio station in Athens, Georgia, where she chose to attend college after reading <i>Gone With the Wind</i> one too many times. Over the last twenty years she has written and produced a wide range of corporate and broadcast projects and has worked on commercials and feature films. She is also an experienced on-air and voice-over talent and hosted a live radio talk show called <i>Desperate &amp; Dateless</i> in the early eighties.<br><br>She lives in Atlanta with her husband and their two elementary school-age boys.Chapter 1<br><br>For the first time in her thirty-three-year-old life, Shelley Schwartz faked an orgasm. On principle she was opposed to this idea and had, in debates with her friends, been very smug about always hanging in there even if the payoff was more like a blip on the Richter scale than a full-scale movement of the earth.<br><br>A woman should never be cruel or unsympathetic in bed, she'd argued, but pretending that something she didn't like might actually lead to an orgasm had potentially dangerous ramifications; how could a woman go into paroxysms of ecstasy over something one day and then fail to get off on it the next? It was Pavlovian training at its most dysfunctional--and most men didn't need any help or encouragement in failing to satisfy.<br><br>But today she'd gotten stuck between a rock and a hard place. Well, actually it had been a mattress and Trey Davenport's superbly sculpted chest.<br><br>Faking it had turned out to be her only viable option.<br><br>Because although her body had been pinned beneath Trey's very studly one, her mind had been trained on her two-thirty meeting--the one at which she intended to show her father and everyone else at the advertising agency that she was not the cream puff they believed her to be. The meeting she'd spent months preparing for, and which she was now racing to at the speed of sound.<br>Shelley coasted through a four-way stop then mashed down the accelerator, still trying to figure out how an innocent lunch had turned into such a sexual Waterloo.<br><br>She'd invited Trey to the Ritz for his birthday, certain they'd have plenty of time for a celebratory lunch before her meeting. Things had been going swimmingly until he dangled the room key in front of her.<br><br>She'd felt the smile freeze on her lips, but Trey was a truly sweet and very hunky guy and it was his birthday; she simply couldn't tell him she'd rather go back to the office and pitch a feminine hygiene account. "This is my chance to be taken seriously at work" wasn't going to cut it with a man who'd just turned thirty-five, consumed most of a bottle of Cristal, and was looking at her like she was the icing on his cake.<br><br>Unsure what to do, she'd acted pleased and figured if they got right to it, she'd be showered and dressed in plenty of time.<br><br>This might have worked except that Trey, ever the gentleman, kept waiting for her to go first. Only Shelley wasn't going anywhere anytime soon and Trey, who ran marathons and climbed mountains, could go for hours if properly motivated. This had never seemed like a bad thing. Until today.<br>But even as she'd stared at the ceiling and admitted defeat she'd realized it wasn't fair to penalize Trey just because she was throwing in the sexual towel. Surely all God's children deserved an orgasm on their birthday.<br><br>So she'd kicked up their rhythm, whispered things in his ear that actually made her blush, and urged him on, giving an Oscar-worthy performance of turned-on womanhood.<br><br>And then when she could tell he was hanging on by the very slimmest of threads she'd done it, the thing she'd argued so vehemently against. She'd impersonated herself at her free-falling, <br>head-banging best and forced Trey Davenport to follow suit.<br>Despite the compromising of her sexual principles, the meeting was already under way by the time Shelley arrived. The Easy To Be Me people sat with their backs to the conference room door; the Schwartz and Associates team aligned across from them. Her father sat at the head of the table with the indispensable Ross Morgan at his left.<br><br>Both men turned as she skidded to a halt in the doorway. Her father sighed. Ross Morgan looked at her as if she were a car wreck he couldn't bear to watch. The conversation sputtered to a stop and everyone else turned to see what they were looking at.<br><br>"This is my daughter Shelley," her father announced to the now-silent room.<br><br>She swallowed and nodded then forced a smile to her lips. It was only as she moved toward the empty seat at the foot of the table that she noticed the huge run in her stocking. Her heart stopped as she realized that the jacket of her lilac Donna Karan suit, the one she'd bought specifically for this presentation, was misbuttoned, and that the contrasting aqua shell was inside out, the label clearly visible.<br><br>She might as well be wearing a sign that read "Delayed due to sex, doesn't know how to dress herself."<br><br>Shit, shit, shit. She'd showered in under two minutes, thrown on her clothes, then touched up her makeup in the rearview mirror as she raced to the office. Obviously she should have taken that extra ten seconds in the hotel room for a full-length glimpse.<br><br>"I'm sorry I'm late," she said, not even bothering to try to explain. What was there to say? "It's inside-out day at Schwartz and Associates, didn't you get the memo?"<br><br>Pulling her notes out of her Louis Vuitton carryall, she decided she'd be a very old woman before she allowed herself to go anywhere near the Ritz at lunchtime again. In fact, she'd give up the Ritz, and possibly sex, for life if Trey's birthday orgasm didn't cost her the opportunity she'd been waiting for.<br>Ross Morgan speared her with his blue eyes and a familiar tic appeared in his cheek, but it was her father's gaze, filled with disappointment and resignation, that sent the chill up her spine.<br><br>Shelley wanted to point out that she'd only been ten minutes late. It wasn't as if she'd blown off the whole thing, or not bothered to do her homework; she knew this client's products like she knew the clearance rack at Neiman's.<br><br>Her father gave her a "Don't say a word or you're grounded" look, and Shelley bit her lip and lowered her gaze while Ross Morgan directed everyone's attention back to the storyboards in front of them.<br><br>As the meeting progressed, her research was quoted freely, and her ideas were presented and approved, but she wasn't invited to speak. She felt like a child who'd accidentally used a bad word in front of the adults and been banished from polite society.<br><br>If Ross Morgan had been ten minutes late, he could have waltzed right in and still taken command of the group. But of course he would have been ten minutes early, not late. And he wouldn't have jeopardized his career in order to give someone an orgasm. Not that he didn't know how to give a woman the "Big O," as she unfortunately knew after ending up in that supply closet with him during last year's holiday party. But he never would have risked business for one. He was always in control of his considerable faculties; always focused, always so sure. How dare he turn out to be the son her father never had!<br><br>Shelley kept her gaze fixed on the exposed brick wall of the conference room and worried at her bottom lip until she tasted blood. Forty minutes later there were handshakes all around and Ross--not her--was promising to get things under way, to be in touch, expressing enthusiasm over the opportunity to work together. He promised that they'd be glad they'd put their advertising dollars with Schwartz and Associates.<br><br>As usual, she was the Schwartz in disgrace; he was the man in charge.<br><br>The Easy To Be Me people filed out of the conference room and the rest of the staff followed.<br><br>"Shelley," her father said, "you and Ross come with me." They followed in silence and sank into chairs across from his desk in the big corner office. Still silent, Harvey Schwartz studied them both.<br><br>"Daddy, I'm sorry, I . . ."<br><br>Her father ran a hand through his graying hair and sighed again. "Never mind, sweetheart. Perhaps we expected too much of you this time."<br><br>"No." When had her father ever expected anything of her? "I can handle this. I did the research, a lot of the ideas were mine."<br><br>"Yes, Ross told me that."<br><br>Well at least he hadn't tried to snatch the credit. "This account is perfect for me."<br><br>"Yes." He smiled sadly. "But are you perfect for the account?" He let the question hang in the air. "<br><br>Your prep work was first-rate, but you weren't here when the time came to close the deal. You can't pick and choose which parts of the job you're going to do."<br><br>Ross stared out the window, his expression making it clear he wasn't going to weigh in on the subject. So why was he there? she wondered miserably. Why was he always there being so damned competent? And why did she keep screwing up?<br><br>"It won't happen again, Daddy. Just let me have this account. Let me show you what I can do."<br><br>Her father sighed again. He was forever chucking her under the chin like a child, or sighing over her. <br><br>"I'm sorry, Shelley, but I just can't take the chance. We're talking billings of more than a million dollars. You can work on the account, but you'll work under Ross's guidance. He'll decide what your role will be and how much responsibility to give you."<br><br>His intercom buzzed, and his secretary's voice squawked in the too-quiet room. "I've got to take this call. Why don't you two sit down over a cup of coffee and hash it out? There's plenty of work for everyone."<br><br>But not plenty of room to earn credit for the success of this campaign.<br><br>Shelley followed her nemesis out of the office and down the long hallway. It would be easier to hate him if he'd just go ahead and be a jerk, rub it in, lord it over her. But he was always polite and completely professional. Well, except for that time in the supply closet.<br><br>Why couldn't he be short and balding with a squeaky nerd voice, instead of tall and blond with that deep rumbly baritone? Life was so unfair.<br><br>Ross paused at the door to his own corner office. "So do you want to discuss this now, or would you like to go finish dressing?"<br><br>She was tempted to pull off the blouse and redress in front of him just to see the expression on his face. She hated that he was everything her father wanted and that she apparently was not. What was the point of trying to be professional? When no one expected anything of you, how long could you keep trying to prove them wrong?<br><br>"I'm as dressed as I plan to be," Shelley replied quietly. "But my nails are a bit ragged." She looked down at them as if they mattered then raised her chin a notch. "I don't think we need to have this same old motivational chat, do you? You don't really want me mucking around in this account, and we both know my father doesn't really care whether I help or not."<br><br>She cocked her head to the side and looked at him from beneath her lashes. "I think I'll just run out and get my nails done, maybe do a little shopping."<br><br>He didn't try to stop her, didn't argue, didn't do anything but look at her out of those serious blue eyes. As if she were some alien species that he'd never run across before.<br><br>Her pride was about all she had propping her up, so she kept her tone light and her chin up as she turned to leave. "I'm pretty sure that's what daddy's girls are supposed to do."<br>Chapter 2<br><br>Shelley shopped until the stores closed. Like an alcoholic hanging in until the last call, she prowled the aisles of her favorite stores until the doors locked behind her at ten p.m. The hurt had begun to numb in the lingerie department of Saks. By the time she picked up a new Kate Spade bag at Bloomingdale's, she was close to philosophic. No one really expected her to work a full-time job, and her salary was clearly not dependent on her performance.<br><br>So she'd made a mistake. So she'd shown up late and embarrassingly disheveled for the most important business meeting of her life. Beating herself up about it was getting her exactly nowhere.<br><br>Letting herself into her Buckhead condo, Shelley dropped her shopping bags in the foyer, moved into the black-and-white kitchen, and dialed her voice mailbox number. Cradling the phone against her shoulder, she flipped the kitchen shutters closed on the view of midtown Atlanta and sank onto a kitchen chair to listen to her messages.<br><br>"Shelley, it's Nina. I'm taking a personal day tomorrow. I'm thinking the nine a.m. Pilates and lunch at Panera's. Then I was thinking facial. A best friend is supposed to tell a girl when her pores look like moon craters."<br><br>The next voice belonged to her mother. As usual, Miriam Schwartz wasted no time on a greeting. "Daddy told me you left early today." There was a pause. "I hope you're not too upset; there'll be other accounts. Don't forget dinner tomorrow night. We're going to do the whole Friday night thing. Marilyn Friedlander's grandson is in town and I invited him to join us."<br><br>Shelley rolled her eyes.<br><br>"Don't roll your eyes at me." Even through the receiver and cyberspace, or wherever this message had been stored, her mother's irritation was clear. "He's a very nice boy. An accountant. A girl could do worse."<br><br>Yes, a girl could, Shelley reflected as she listened to the remaining messages, and often had. Her mother's steady stream of Jewish men had covered every legitimate profession and a few that told her just how desperate her mother had grown. She'd known she was in deep shit when Malcolm the Maccabee, a rising star on the professional wrestling circuit, had shown up for a family meal.<br><br>Of course, she hadn't done that well on her own, either. Her choices were almost always blond-haired, blue-eyed, and athletic like Trey. It was no fun to be out with someone you thought you could hurt or outwrestle--but their one common attribute had been their non-Jewishness and their inability to commit--at least to her.<br><br>Trey's message reminded her that some good had come out of what she now thought of as the Ritz fiasco.<br><br>"Thanks for the, uh, birthday send-off." The smile in his voice was clear.<br><br>She smiled in response as she remembered his shout of pleasure and the warmth with which he'd shown his gratitude.<br><br>"I'm leaving for that white-water trip in the morning, but I'll call you when we get back to civilization."<br><br>Good old Trey, so Waspy, so rugged. As long as he didn't expect her to rough it with him, they'd get along just fine.<br><br>Her older sister's voice came next--rushed and out of breath as usual. Most of Judy Schwartz Blumfeld's calls were placed via cell phone from car pool lines or Little League fields. And they were almost always instructional in nature. "Shel, will you bring those fabric swatches I left at your house to Mom and Dad's tomorrow night? The bar mitzvah coordinator wants to see them. I'm thinking about using them for the central color theme."<br><br>Her nephew Sammy's bar mitzvah, whose theme was apparently "Bigger Than Ben-Hur," was a mere five months away.<br><br>"I understand Mom found you an accountant this time," her sister concluded. "Maybe you should bring your tax forms so it isn't a total loss."<br><br>Ha, ha. Shelley moved to the refrigerator and pulled out a Diet Coke. Easy for Judy to joke. She'd married a lawyer and produced two sons, thereby fulfilling their parents' fondest hopes. She had done everything Shelley was now supposed to do, but didn't want to. And tomorrow night Judy would have her whole perfect family with her. If you added the accountant to the equation, you had the perfect end to the perfect week.</p><h2>At the Mountain&#39;s Edge</h2><p><b>From bestselling author Genevieve Graham comes a sweeping new historical novel of love, tragedy, and redemption set during the height of the Klondike Gold Rush.</b><br><br>In 1897, the discovery of gold in the desolate reaches of the Yukon has the world abuzz with excitement, and thousands of prospectors swarm to the north seeking riches the likes of which have never been seen before. <br> <br>For Liza Peterson and her family, the gold rush is a chance for them to make a fortune by moving their general store business from Vancouver to Dawson City, the only established town in the Yukon.

No one else in the room made a sound. She glanced at her mother, wondering if perhaps she&#x2019;d misheard her father&#x2019;s words, but she looked as bewildered as Liza felt. Even Stan had been stunned into silence, and that was rare. Her brother usually had something to say about everything. She let her breath out slowly, timing it with the sober tick-tock of the old clock on the mantel behind her, waiting for her father to laugh and assure them he&#x2019;d been joking.<br> <br>Up until a minute ago, the evening had been like any other. Liza had been absorbed in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&#x2014;though if her brother would stop spouting trivia about the rubber forests of Nicaragua or whatever it was from his latest National Geographic Magazine she would have been even more engrossed in it. On the other side of the room, her mother had been quietly sewing in her armchair by the fire while Liza&#x2019;s father set out his pipe and tobacco, the ledgers for the family&#x2019;s general store spread in front of him.<br> <br>Then, as calmly as one might announce they were going for a walk up the street, her father had declared his intention to move both the family and their business from Vancouver to Dawson City, in the Yukon. That&#x2019;s when Liza had laughed, and the choked sound had fallen flat in the ensuing silence.<br> <br>&#x201c;They call it the &#x2018;Paris of the North,&#x2019;?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>To Liza&#x2019;s bewilderment, he looked absolutely thrilled about the idea, and he was regarding his family as though they&#x2019;d leap at the opportunity. Certainly she would, given the chance to see the real Paris. But this?<br> <br>After an uncomfortable pause, Liza&#x2019;s mother spoke. &#x201c;Arthur, what on earth are you talking about?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;An adventure the likes of which none of us have ever imagined, my dear.&#x201d; He beamed, drawing out his answer as he drew out the lighting of his pipe. The aromatic smoke began curling above their heads, but its normal ability to soothe Liza was absent tonight. She was as impatient as her mother to know more.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just because the rest of the world is taking leave of its senses,&#x201d; her mother said, lips tight, &#x201c;that does not mean this family must do the same.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Think of the business, Agatha,&#x201d; Liza&#x2019;s father replied. &#x201c;The Klondike Gold Rush is the opportunity of a lifetime. We shall build a future in which all our roads are, quite literally, paved in gold.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, thank you,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;I am more than satisfied on our present muddy road. As far as the business is concerned, I am quite content. Thanks to this gold phenomenon, the depression is finally lifting, and while I&#x2019;ll admit the past few years have been challenging, our store is already doing much better. The prospectors are buying their supplies from us, so there is no need for us to move to the distant wilds.&#x201d;<br> <br>As her parents spoke, Liza cast a glance at her brother. He appeared to have recovered from his shock, and from the eager lean of his body Liza could practically see a pick and shovel already clenched in his hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;Father, I think this is a marvellous idea,&#x201d; Stan said, sounding more like an excited little boy than a young man of twenty-two. &#x201c;Besides, I&#x2019;d love to ride a dogsled.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be absurd,&#x201d; Liza said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know the first thing about dogsledding. You&#x2019;d end up in a snowdrift.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I wouldn&#x2019;t. There was a dogsled display set up outside the Vancouver Hardware shop today, and the shopkeeper was demonstrating how to drive them. It didn&#x2019;t look all that difficult.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw that display, too. The four raggedy mongrels they&#x2019;d hitched to it hardly looked as if they were up to that type of journey.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So now you&#x2019;re an expert?&#x201d;<br> <br>Liza closed her eyes. Once Stan had something on his mind, there was no way to get around it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t think so. Clubb and Stewart over on Cordova Street call themselves &#x2018;Klondike Outfitters,&#x2019; so I imagine they&#x2019;d know all about it. I could go ask them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Their father cleared his throat, interrupting their banter. &#x201c;No doubt Mr. Clubb would be happy to sell you whatever your heart desires for four times the usual price.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If supplies are so expensive,&#x201d; her mother interjected, &#x201c;then I don&#x2019;t see how we can afford this venture.&#x201d;<br> <br>Liza did. For the past three years, she&#x2019;d peeked at the store ledgers when her father wasn&#x2019;t looking, fascinated by the columns of figures, the rise and fall of sales. Last year, when the newspapers had announced the discovery of gold in the Yukon, she&#x2019;d watched as the store&#x2019;s numbers soared to a thrilling new height. But she never told her father she&#x2019;d done that. Ever since they&#x2019;d first set up their store in Vancouver, Liza had worked behind the counter. She&#x2019;d only been ten years old, and her father had quickly noticed the magnetic effect her bright smile had on customers. Now, at twenty, Liza still loved running the cash, but she longed to do more and had asked her father if she could work on the ledgers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your job is to help the customers,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can do more than count change,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d insisted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Leave the accounting to me. It&#x2019;s a man&#x2019;s job.&#x201d;<br> <br>The remark bothered her, but none of her attempts to change his mind worked, so she took matters into her own hands. She figured it wouldn&#x2019;t do anyone any harm if she quietly taught herself how the shop&#x2019;s finances worked, and one of the first things she discovered was that her father was an adept businessman. Now she realized she should have suspected something was brewing. He&#x2019;d been studying the newspapers with more intensity of late, and she&#x2019;d noticed him stockpiling snowshoes and other outdoor equipment. She just hadn&#x2019;t imagined any of it might be for their personal use.<br> <br>&#x201c;We wouldn&#x2019;t be mining, would we?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;We know nothing about mining.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; her father replied. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d be mining the miners. Trust me, Liza. This is an incredible opportunity. We cannot lose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But we could mine, right?&#x201d; Stan pressed.<br> <br>A tiny whistle sang through the room as her father drew on his pipe. &#x201c;If you can find the time, I don&#x2019;t see why not. But our priority will be in establishing the business, because in order to afford what we will need in Dawson City, I will be selling both the shop and this house.&#x201d;<br> <br>Liza caught her breath, and her fingers dug into the arms of her chair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Arthur,&#x201d; her mother said carefully, &#x201c;I know your heart is set on this, but it seems . . . irresponsible. To start with, the Yukon is not the place for a young lady.&#x201d;<br> <br>Liza&#x2019;s thoughts touched on handsome Charles MacGillvray, the young man who stopped by to see her at the store every so often. Charles hadn&#x2019;t done anything more than flirt over the counter, and Liza didn&#x2019;t feel a terrible longing when he wasn&#x2019;t around, but she did feel a tug of regret at being denied the opportunity to see how things might go between the two of them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Our daughter is not a dainty flower,&#x201d; her father said, appraising her. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s made of stronger stuff.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Am I?&#x201d; Liza asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Certainly. You&#x2019;ve never shied away from hard work. Besides, you and your mother would always be with Stan and me, safe from any possible threats.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Stan would protect me, would he?&#x201d; Liza gave her brother a sideways look.<br> <br>Stan ignored her and turned to their mother. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go, Mother,&#x201d; he urged. &#x201c;Think of it! The Klondike Gold Fields! It&#x2019;s a strike like no one has ever seen before, and it&#x2019;s so close!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Close?&#x201d; Liza said. &#x201c;For someone who reads as much as you do, you might want to brush up on geography.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean as compared to the rest of the world, obviously. People are travelling to the Yukon from all over&#x2014;America, Europe, England&#x2014;and all of them are much farther away than we are. After a few weeks up there, they return home with boats full of gold. I read some have more than a hundred thousand dollars of gold with them! Think of that: a hundred thousand dollars!&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mother studied the three of them. &#x201c;There will be no more talk of the Yukon. The Petersons are not embarking on another wild goose chase, and that&#x2019;s that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Another wild goose chase?&#x201d; Liza&#x2019;s father asked, his smile fading.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what I&#x2019;m talking about, Arthur. Our life in Toronto was perfectly fine. Because of you, I bid my family goodbye and we uprooted everything so we could move to this rough, rainy place.&#x201d; She kept her eyes on him as she stabbed her sewing needle through the coat she was mending. &#x201c;Since then we&#x2019;ve poured our lives and everything we have into the store&#x2014;and now that business is finally starting to improve, you want to move us again. It&#x2019;s not fair, Arthur.&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence descended over the room. Toronto meant little to Liza, since she and Stan had been very young when the family had come to Vancouver. The voyage had seemed like an adventure to them&#x2014;no one else they knew had ever taken a train!&#x2014;and they&#x2019;d both settled in well. But Liza knew her mother still longed for the family she&#x2019;d left behind. Especially her sister, to whom she still wrote weekly letters. While she did seem happier now that the store was doing well, whenever Liza made any passing mention of Toronto her mother drooped like a wilted flower, speaking wistfully of its bustling streets with their colourful shops and window displays, recalling the dances and parties she had attended regularly before she&#x2019;d met her husband.<br> <br>Liza&#x2019;s father rose and crossed the room, surprising them all when he knelt at the side of his wife&#x2019;s chair. He carefully pried her sewing needle from between her fingers, then took her hands in his own.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve sacrificed so much for our family, my dear,&#x201d; he said gently, &#x201c;and yet I am begging for more. Yes, our store is relatively successful, but we are still a small fish and the market here is saturated. Because of that, I fear we may never reach our potential.&#x201d; He kissed her knuckles. &#x201c;I want more for you, Agatha. I want to give you the life I promised you when we married.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her expression eased. &#x201c;Oh, Arthur. You have.&#x201d;<br> <br>His fingers skimmed along the faded upholstery on the arm of her chair, then paused over the worn patch near her elbow. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t what I promised you. You deserve so much more. Do you remember the day I took you to the Crystal Palace? How you said you would love to see the original in London? I promised I would someday give you the world, and now I can take you to the top of it. From there, the sky is the limit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We talked about a lot of things,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;Young people always have dreams they can&#x2019;t fulfil.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And yet here we are, a quarter of a century later, and I still dream. We have been so busy these past few years with family and work that I fear we have discarded whatever youthful aspirations we once held. I confess this gold fever has lit a fire in my heart, a desire to explore the unexplored, a thirst for adventure, and it is my hope that I have only to ignite this passion within your own heart for you to feel a similar longing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that right? Am I to be so easily swayed?&#x201d;<br> <br>Liza had never heard her father speak this way, of hearts and adventures, of promises and dreams, and though her mother appeared unmoved, her voice had softened.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see it not as swaying you so much as reminding you.&#x201d;<br> <br>After a moment, her mother spoke again. &#x201c;How would we live, if we were to do this thing? How does it work?&#x201d;<br> <br>In that instant, Liza saw herself in the future, and her throat tightened. The Liza in her mind stepped out of her home, suitcase in hand, and the door closed behind her with a terrible click of finality. Travel to the Yukon? She shuddered at the thought. Why, that was thousands of miles away. And wasn&#x2019;t it buried in snow twelve months of the year? Vancouver at its worst was only ever inconvenienced by two inches of the stuff.<br> <br>Everyone else might be fine with this plan, but Liza did not want to go. Absolutely not. No matter how much gold was buried up there, she had no interest in leaving Vancouver. Everything she knew was here. Of course she&#x2019;d admired the sun blazing on the distant mountain peaks before, wondering what it might be like to stand up there and look down over the city, but those had never been more than passing, romantic thoughts. Never, ever had she dreamed of climbing a mountain. But now . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;Will it be a temporary thing?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;I mean, we would return to Vancouver afterwards, wouldn&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It would last as long as it needs to.&#x201d; The smile that spread across her father&#x2019;s face was full of wonder. &#x201c;The world will be stretched out before us, and the opportunities are boundless.&#x201d;<br> <br>She hesitated. &#x201c;But we don&#x2019;t have to leave right away, do we?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh yes,&#x201d; he said, getting to his feet. Now that the matter was resolved, he had a bounce to his step. &#x201c;As soon as possible, if we are to stay ahead of the pack.&#x201d;<br> <br>Liza looked to her mother, who had resumed her mending with new purpose, but she wouldn&#x2019;t meet Liza&#x2019;s eye. She would follow her husband without any further questions, Liza knew.<br> <br>As her father left the room, Liza leaned back in her chair, her head spinning. How could they possibly travel to the wild frontiers of the Yukon? How would they know what to do? How would they look after themselves? The more she thought about it, the more frightened she became. She had no question that her father was a smart man, that he believed this move was the right thing for all of them, but it sounded more than a little crazy to Liza. She let her breath out slowly, trying to ease the panic that had tightened her chest. Her father would take care of them, she reminded herself. He would do everything he could to prepare them for the road ahead. All Liza had to do was trust him. And she did. With all her heart.<br> <br>The problem was that she didn&#x2019;t trust the Yukon.</p><h2>Living in Two Worlds: The American Indian Experience (American Indian Traditions)</h2><p>This beautifully illustrated book presents a vivid account of the American Indian experience as seen through the eyes of Charles Eastman (Ohiyesa), the first and greatest of the Native American authors.

He died in 1939.

It&#x2019;s 1900 in Oregon, and Olivia&#x2019;s father, concerned that she&#x2019;s headed for trouble, convinces a stage mesmerist to try to hypnotize the rebellion out of her. But the hypnotist, an intriguing young man named Henri Reverie, gives her a terrible gift instead: she&#x2019;s able to see people&#x2019;s true natures, manifesting as visions of darkness and goodness, while also unable to speak her true thoughts out loud. These supernatural challenges only make Olivia more determined to speak her mind, and so she&#x2019;s drawn into a dangerous relationship with the hypnotist and his mysterious motives, all while secretly fighting for the rights of women. Winters breathes new life into history once again with an atmospheric, vividly real story, including archival photos and art from the period throughout.<br><br>Praise for <i>The Cure for Dreaming</i><br> "A smattering of period photos adds authenticity to this gripping, atmospheric story of mind control and self-determination."<br> --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br> &nbsp;</p><p>Cat Winters is the author of <i>In the Shadow of Blackbirds</i>, which received three starred reviews and was a finalist for YALSA&#x2019;s Morris Award for debut YA fiction. She grew up near Disneyland in Southern California. She lives in Portland, Oregon, with her family.<br>Gr 9 Up&#x2014;What if you could tell a person's true nature just by his appearance? Emotional vampires would be represented with fangs and a ghastly pallor; feeble, miserable individuals would flicker in and out of existence. Winters's latest historical novel, set in Portland, Oregon, in the year 1900, explores this question and others. The daughter of a cruel dentist, Olivia Mead is called onto stage at a show to be hypnotized by the young yet famous Henri Reverie. Her furious father enlists Reverie's help to browbeat Olivia into her proper role as a woman, forcing her to "see the world the way it truly is." When Olivia realizes she cannot voice her dissent and that she can truly see peoples' natures, she must take her future into her own hands with the help of Reverie&#x2014;all set within the backdrop of a dynamic suffragist movement. Winters combines the history of women's rights in the early 20th century with a spellbinding story of a young woman caught at a crossroads between family and self. A strong female protagonist, realistic dialogue, and well-written prose allow readers to become immersed in Olivia's rather unique (and sometimes frightening) world. Aesthetically, bibliophiles and novices alike will love the old-fashioned introductory chapter photographs with leading quotes.&#x2014;Amanda C.

In this endlessly entertaining follow-up to his bestselling social history <i>740 Park</i>, Gross pulls back the shades of secrecy that have long shrouded the upper class&#x2019;s cultural and philanthropic ambitions and maneuvers. And he paints a revealing portrait of a previously hidden face of American wealth and power.<br><br>The Metropolitan, Gross writes, &#x201c;is a huge alchemical experiment, turning the worst of man&#x2019;s attributes&#x2014;extravagance, lust, gluttony, acquisitiveness, envy, avarice, greed, egotism, and pride&#x2014;into the very best, transmuting deadly sins into priceless treasure.&#x201d; The book covers the entire 138-year history of the Met, focusing on the museum&#x2019;s most colorful characters. Opening with the lame-duck director Philippe de Montebello, the museum&#x2019;s longest-serving leader who finally stepped down in 2008, <i>Rogues&#x2019; Gallery</i> then goes back to the very beginning, highlighting, among many others: the first director, Luigi Palma di Cesnola, an Italian-born epic phony, whose legacy is a trove of plundered ancient relics, some of which remain on display today; John Pierpont Morgan, the greatest capitalist and art collector of his day, who turned the museum from the plaything of a handful of rich amateurs into a professional operation dedicated, sort of, to the public good; John D. Rockefeller Jr., who never served the Met in any official capacity but who, during the Great Depression, proved the only man willing and rich enough to be its benefactor, which made him its behind-the-scenes puppeteer; the controversial Thomas Hoving, whose tenure as director during the sixties and seventies revolutionized museums around the world but left the Met in chaos; and Jane Engelhard and Annette de la Renta, a mother-daughter trustee tag team whose stories will astonish you (think <i>Casablanca</i> rewritten by Edith Wharton).<br><br>With a supporting cast that includes artists, forgers, and looters, financial geniuses and scoundrels, museum officers (like its chairman Arthur Amory Houghton, head of Corning Glass, who once ripped apart a priceless and ancient Islamic book in order to sell it off piecemeal), trustees (like Jayne Wrightsman, the Hollywood party girl turned society grand dame), curators (like the aging Dietrich von Bothmer, a refugee from Nazi Germany with a Bronze Star for heroism whose greatest acquisitions turned out to be looted), and donors (like Irwin Untermyer, whose collecting obsession drove his wife and children to suicide), and with cameo appearances by everyone from <i>Vogue </i>editors Anna Wintour and Diana Vreeland to Sex Pistols front man Johnny Rotten, <i>Rogues&#x2019; Gallery</i> is a rich, satisfying, alternately hilarious and horrifying look at America&#x2019;s upper class, and what is perhaps its greatest creation.</p><p>Provocative cultural journalist and <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author <b>Michael Gross</b> is currently a<i> </i>contributing editor at <i>Travel &amp; Leisure</i>. He has<i> </i>previously held positions at the <i>New York Times</i>,<i> New York</i>, <i>Radar</i>, <i>George</i>, and <i>Esquire</i>.<i> </i>His writing has appeared in <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Interview</i>,<i> Details</i>, <i>Elle</i>, <i>Architectural Digest</i>, <i>American Photo</i>,<i><br>Town &amp; Country</i>, and <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, and he has also written for the <i>Washington Post</i>, the <i>International</i> <i>Herald Tribune</i>, the <i>Village Voice</i>, the <i>San Francisco</i> <i>Chronicle</i>, and the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>.

He currently lives in New York City.On a chilly winter day, early in 2006, I sat in the office of Philippe de Montebello, then director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (he would announce his retirement two years later). Montebello is generally considered, even by his most fervent admirers, a little arrogant, a touch on the pompous side, and his mid-Atlantic Voice of God (well-known from his Acoustiguide tours of exhibitions) does nothing to dispel the impression of a healthy self-regard. So I was nervous; I was there to discuss my plan to write an unauthorized book about the museum and to ask for his support, or, at least, his neutrality. <br><br>He wasn&#x2019;t happy to see me. <br><br>Ever since its founding, the Metropolitan has bred arrogance, hauteur, hubris, vanity and even madness in those who live in proximity to its multitude of treasures and who have come to feel not just protective but possessive of them. &#x201c;Being involved with it made you special to the outside world,&#x201d; says Stuart Silver, for years the museum&#x2019;s chief exhibition designer. &#x201c;It was a narcotic. You were high all the time.&#x201d; <br>The Metropolitan is more than a mere drug, though. It is a huge alchemical experiment, turning the worst of man&#x2019;s attributes&#x2014;extravagance, lust, gluttony, acquisitiveness, envy, avarice, greed, egotism and pride&#x2014;into the very best, transmuting deadly sins into priceless treasure. So the museum must be seen as something separate from the often imperfect individuals who created it, who sustained it and who run it today, something greater than the sum of their myriad flaws. <br><br>Without taking anything away from The Louvre or the Orsay in Paris, Madrid&#x2019;s Prado, St. Petersburg&#x2019;s Hermitage, The British Museum (which has no pictures), Britain&#x2019;s National Gallery (which has only pictures and sculpture), the Vatican in Rome, the Uffizi in Florence, Vienna&#x2019;s Kunsthistoriches Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, Berlin&#x2019;s Pergamon, Amsterdam&#x2019;s Rijksmuseum, the Smithsonian Institute and its National Gallery of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Getty in Malibu or other vital New York museums like the Whitney, the Guggenheim, and the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan is simply (and at the same time not at all simply) the most encyclopedic, universal art museum in the world. <br><br>In Montebello&#x2019;s office that day, he&#x2019;d been slumped sullenly in his chair as I made my pitch, but straightened up as I finished. &#x201c;You are laboring under a misimpression,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;The museum has no secrets.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>From its inception, oversized personalities have dominated the Metropolitan; many loom large in American history, too. John Jay, grandson of the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, first conceived of it. William Cullen Bryant, the orator, poet, journalist, publisher and club man was one of the most eloquent advocates of the museum&#x2019;s creation. In recent times, its board heads have been some of America&#x2019;s most powerful men: in the 1930s, George Blumenthal, who headed Lazard Fr�res; in the 1960s, C. Douglas Dillon, John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s Secretary of the Treasury; in the 1970s, Robert Lehman, the head of Lehman Brothers and in the 1980s, Arthur Ochs &#x201c;Punch&#x201d; Sulzberger, the chairman of <i>The New York Times</i>. <br><br>Some of these characters defined distinct eras in the museum&#x2019;s colorful history. Luigi Palma di Cesnola, named the first director by the mostly self-made founders, was an Italian count, a Civil War veteran given to inflating his rank, an American diplomat and an amateur archaeologist, some of whose finds from Cyprus remain treasures in the museum&#x2019;s collections today; his excesses mark it still. J. Pierpont Morgan is credited with turning the Met from a semi-private clubhouse for the trustees into a professional operation. <br><br>Following Morgan and dominating throughout the mid-20th century, though never serving as a trustee or officer, John D. Rockefeller Jr. was quietly its greatest benefactor and his relationship with James Rorimer, the sixth director, was a model for the symbiosis between the rich and the scholarly that made the Met blossom even more after Morgan. Hoving, a scholar but also a showman like Cesnola, was appointed by a board of trustees led by a group of gun-slinging veterans of John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s New Frontier administration; he re-invented the Met, and in the process redefined all museums during his mere ten years as director, beginning in 1966. <br><br>Ever since the beginning, the Met has been a political, cultural and social spectacle, especially when all three come together in the cauldron of fundraising. Then the fun really begins. You can get a seat on the board by wielding power (like Henry Kissinger, who was recruited to lend geopolitical savvy), or waving your family bloodline or corporate flag (among the Met&#x2019;s brand-name trustee dynasties have been Morgans, Astors, Whitneys, Rockefellers, Annenbergs, Houghtons and various representatives of the Lazard Fr�res investment bank) or possessing a useful skill (like any number of financiers, developers and the media titans Reid, Luce, and Sulzberger). But money counts most of all: a commitment to donate six figure sums every year, or to twist the arms of other potential givers. &#x201c;Give, get, or get out,&#x201d; is the rule. <br>&nbsp;<br>Back in Philippe de Montebello&#x2019;s office, I wound up my pitch for the museum&#x2019;s cooperation... and left the room shortly after with the distinct feeling that I was on my own. For I already knew that a curtain of secrecy had been hung over the museum long before Montebello&#x2019;s time. With the stakes so high and the money and egos involved so big, the Met has always had to operate in the shade, whether it was acquiring art under questionable circumstances, dealing with donors hoping to launder very sketchy reputations, or merely trying to appear above reproach in a world where behind almost every painting is a fortune and behind that, a sin or a crime. The Metropolitan Museum is a storehouse of human memory. But it appeared, that day at least, it would just as soon its own be erased.</p><h2>Not My Fathers Son</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

Or, in the case of Alan Cumming, they can be packed away in a box, stuck in the attic to be forgotten. Until one day the box explodes and all the memories flood back in horrible detail. Alan Cumming grew up in the grip of a man who held his family hostage, someone who meted out violence with a frightening ease, who waged a silent war with himself that sometimes spilled over onto everyone around him. That man was Alex Cumming, Alan's father.</p><p>When television producers approached Alan to appear on a popular celebrity genealogy show in 2010, he enthusiastically agreed. He hoped to solve a mystery that had long cast a shadow over his family. His maternal grandfather, Tommy Darling, had disappeared into the Far East after WWII. Alan's mother knew very little about him&#x2014;he had been a courier, carrying information between battalions on his motorbike. The last time she saw her father, Alan's mother was eight years old. When she was thirteen, the family was informed that he had died by his own hand, an accidental shooting.</p><p>But this was not the only mystery laid before Alan's feet. His father, whom Alan had not seen or spoken to for more than a decade, reconnected just before filming for <em>Who Do You Think You Are?</em> began. He had a secret he had to share, one that would shock his son to his very core and set into motion a journey that would change Alan's life forever.</p><p>With ribald humor, wit, and incredible insight, Alan seamlessly moves back and forth in time, integrating stories from his childhood in Scotland and his experiences today as the celebrated actor of film, television, and stage. At times suspenseful, at times deeply moving, but always incredibly brave and honest, <em>Not My Father's Son</em> is a powerful story of embracing the best aspects of the past and triumphantly pushing the darkness aside.</p>Alan Cumming is an award-winning actor, singer, writer, producer and director. He recently starred in an acclaimed one-man staging of Macbeth on Broadway, and appears on the Emmy Award-winning television show The Good Wife. He won a Tony Award for his portrayal of the Emcee in the Broadway musical Cabaret, a role he has reprised in 2014.

In March 1940, the Nazis sweep Paris and immediately take up residence in one of the city&#39;s most iconic sites: The Hotel Ritz. There, under a roof legendary for its unprecedented luxury and for its fabled residents--including Coco Chanel, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Cole Porter, Hemingway, Balanchine, Doris Duke, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and now Hermann Go�ring--the Nazis rule over a paralyzed city. But two residents of the Ritz refuse to be defeated: its manager, Claude Auzello, and his beautiful American actress wife, Blanche. They not only oversee the smooth workings of the hotel, but both Blanche and Claude throw themselves fearlessly into the dangerous and clandestine workings of the French Resistance--a commitment made even more perilous by the fact that, unbeknownst to the Nazis, Blanche is a Jew. This is a true-to-life novel of a courageous woman and her husband who put their marriage--and ultimately their lives--in jeopardy to fight for freedom. Intimate, fearless, and moving, it spins a brilliantly and unforgettably vivid human portrait at a time of unimaginable crisis and sacrifice.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Edogawa Rampo Reader</h2><p>Edogawa Rampo (pseudonym of Hirai Taro, 1894-1965) is the acknowledged grand master of Japan&#39;s golden age of crime and mystery fiction.

He grew up in a world where the white folks are gentlemen by day and Ku Klux Klanners at night. Marion Junction is in Dallas County where as late as 1963, although African-Americans made up over 57 percent of the total county population of 57,000, only 130 were registered voters. After graduating from Dunbar High School in Bessemer, Alabama, in 1937, Boggs took the first freight train north, bumming his way through the western part of the country, working in the hop fields of the state of Washington, cutting ice in Minnesota, and finally ending up in Detroit where he worked on WPA until the Second World War gave him a chance to enter the Chrysler auto plant. Both a keen analysis of U.S. society and a passionate call for revolutionary struggle, The American Revolution has been translated into French, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Catalan, and Portuguese.</p><p></p><h2>The Transforming Power of Grace</h2><p><p>How does an infinite God relate to finite human beings?&nbsp; How does the death of Jesus Christ bring about human salvation?&nbsp; How are Christians able to actively address the world's ills while maintaining their citizenship in the kingdom of God?</p> <p>These are questions the church grapples with today, as it always has.&nbsp; Yet, according to Thomas C. Oden, contemporary theology has neglected the church's traditional answer to these questions: the doctrine of grace.&nbsp; All too often modern theologians either ignore the doctrine of grace or relate it to the achievement of a particular political agenda.&nbsp; Oden asserts that only by reclaiming the centrality of grace--defined as God's self-giving through Jesus Christ in personal encounter with the individual human will--can Christian theology be true to the gospel.</p> <p>In order to reclaim the doctrine of grace, the author reaches back, beyond the fragmentation of theology that took place during and after the Enlightenment.&nbsp; He draws upon the ecumenical consensus held by early Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant theologians, councils, and creeds regarding this cardinal Christian doctrine.&nbsp; By adducing this ancient unity, Oden challenges modern assumptions concerning the sources and methods of the theological enterprise and calls contemporary Christians to discern what their forebears in the faith knew to be essential to the gospel:&nbsp; that to be a Christian is to be formed, nurtured, and upheld solely by divine grace.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Thomas C. Oden, the retired Henry Anson Buttz Professor of Theology and Ethics, is an ancient ecumenical evangelical with a passion for orthodoxy. For over thirty years he taught at Drew University and came under the influence of his &#x201c;irascible, endearing Jewish mentor&#x201d; Will Herberg. Herberg bluntly told Oden that he would remain &#x201c;densely uneducated&#x201d; unless he &#x201c;read deeply in patristic writers.&#x201d;&nbsp; This focus on patristics (the early church fathers) helped professor Oden to realize that modernity is over. As he probed the early church writers for several decades, he incorporated and rechanneled his activism and idealism for the modernist social gospel into a recovery of the classic religious tradition.&nbsp; Scripture found new life in him, which means he repented an enthrallment with progressive social causes in favor of a stable two-thousand year memory, which he defines as orthodoxy.<br></p><h2>Song of the River</h2><p><p>In this resonant story, Cam the mountain boy follows the river from its trickling source in the mountain snow all the way to the coast.

Here, he is caught up in the bustle of an industrial town and thinks that the river has ceased its seaward movement. Beckoned by the waters once again, he continues on, finally finding himself before the expansive ocean, which sings to him of salt and 'secret places where whales/ give birth to their young,' of wharves and waterfalls. <strong>With graceful, rhyming poetry, Cowley articulates the connectedness of nature, while Andrews renders the rush and earnestness of the boy&#x2019;s journe</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> through striated light, city smoke, and the broad, blue sea.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Cam is a young mountain boy who longs to see the sea.

Cam follows the trickle, which joins a creek and runs down the mountainside. The creek meets a stream, where trout leap and beckon Cam. The stream becomes a river that flows through farms with ducks and cows and dogs and then a town. Frogs in the river encourage Cam to continue his journey. The river widens, full of ships big and small. The river sings to Cam, who runs past some wharves and onto the sand dunes. He has reached the sea!

He devised the plan that conquered France in 1940, then led an infantry corps in that campaign; at the head of a panzer corps he reached the gates of Leningrad in 1941, then took command of 11th Army and conquered Sevastopol and the Crimea. After destroying another Soviet army in the north, he was given command of the ad hoc Army Group Don to retrieve the German calamity at Stalingrad, whereupon he launched a counteroffensive that, against all odds, restored the German front. Afterward he commanded Army Group South, nearly crushing the Soviets at Kursk, and then skillfully resisted their relentless attacks, as he traded territory for coherence in the East.<br><br>Though an undoubtedly brilliant military leader&#x2014;whose achievements, considering the forces at his disposal, cast those of Patton, Rommel, MacArthur, and Montgomery in the pale&#x2014;surprisingly little is known about Manstein himself, save for his own memoir and the accolades of his contemporaries. In this book we finally have a full portrait of the man, including his campaigns, and an analysis of what precisely kept a genius such as Manstein harnessed to such a dark cause.<br><br>A great military figure, but a man who lacked a razor-sharp political sense, Manstein was very much representative of the Germano-Prussian military caste of his time. Though Hitler was uneasy about the influence he had gained throughout the German Army, Manstein ultimately declined to join any clandestine plots against his F�hrer, believing they would simply cause chaos, the one thing he abhorred. Even though he constantly opposed Hitler on operational details, he considered it a point of loyalty to simply stand with the German state, in whatever form. <br><br>It is thus through Manstein foremost that the attitudes of other high-ranking officers who fought during the Second World War, particularly on the Eastern Front, can be illuminated. Manstein sought only to serve Germany and was a military man, not a politician. Though not bereft of personal opinions, his primary allegiances were, first, to Deutschland, and second, to the soldiers under his command, who had been committed against an enemy many times their strength. With his grasp of strategy, tactics, and combined arms technology, he proved more than worthy of their confidence. This book is a must-read for all those who wish to understand Germany&#x2019;s primary effort in World War II, as well as its greatest commander.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Introduction<br>I.

Between the noisy construction crew down the street, the whimpers coming from the dog cage that sat in the corner, and the pots and pans his wife was banging around in the kitchen, the baseball game on television had become nearly inaudible. "Jesus Christ, I can&#x2019;t hear myself think!"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lydia appeared at the kitchen doorway. "Like there&#x2019;s anything worth hearing in that so-called brain of yours."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Woman, I swear to God . . ."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here." She handed him a fresh beer and sat on the edge of a hideous orange chair, its matted fabric dingy and stained. "Cubs losing?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl let out a belch. "As usual."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lydia looked down. Crumpled fast food wrappers littered the floor. A glob of ketchup had leaked onto the carpet. As the construction noises down the street grew louder, so too did the whimpers from the cage. She glanced at the telephone, then couldn&#x2019;t stop staring at it. Her breaths became shallow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They haven&#x2019;t called, Carl."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a drag from his cigarette. "They&#x2019;ll call."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You always say that. You&#x2019;re not always right."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lydia. They&#x2019;ll call."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They better," she said, wringing her hands. "I don&#x2019;t want to do <i>that</i> again."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It&#x2019;s up to them, not us. You know that."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lydia picked through her mousy hair with a trembling hand. She shot a resentful glance at her husband and his ever-expanding beer gut, then sniffed the air. "It smells like shit in here."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It <i>is</i> shit."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lydia looked at the dog cage, into the big brown eyes staring back at her. "Maybe we should let him out for a little while."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you kidding me? The last one got halfway down the driveway before I caught him." He took a swig of beer. "You&#x2019;re getting sloppy."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I&#x2019;m just&#x2014;" She stopped and looked around. "Did you hear that?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hear what?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She listened. "I thought maybe&#x2014;the back door&#x2014;"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alarm system&#x2019;s on." He stubbed out his cigarette on the arm of the sofa. "Would you knock it off? You should be used to this by now."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unnerved, Lydia grabbed his empty beer bottle and walked into the kitchen. "At least let me feed the poor thing."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl gestured at the bowl of kibble on the floor. "He&#x2019;s fine. Too fat as he is, if you ask me."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four things happened next.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction crew grew louder, so Carl grabbed the remote and turned up the volume as high as it could go. This just so happened to coincide with a home run, which prompted Carl to let loose with a torrent of obscenities.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, as the living room erupted into a sustained cacophony, Carl never heard the bottle shatter on the kitchen floor. He never heard his wife&#x2019;s tortured screams. And he certainly never heard the intruder enter the living room; in fact, he didn&#x2019;t even realize she was there until she was right in front of him, her eyes peeking out from beneath a black hood, her nose almost touching his.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mr. Scutner," she said, extending a thin, pale finger. "Goodbye, Mr. Scutner."</p> <p>"I&#x2019;m sorry you had to see that," she said a few moments later, opening the door to the dog cage. "Are you okay?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy inside nodded his head, his eyes blurred with tears. She took his hand and led him across the living room, careful not to let him get too close to the scorching remains of his captors.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to go now," she said, grabbing a phone and dialing 911. "But I need you to be brave and do one thing for me." She handed him the phone. "Just tell them who you are and that you&#x2019;re at fifty-one Forest Drive. Then go sit out on the front steps. Can you do that?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wiped his nose and nodded.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good boy. And don&#x2019;t tell anyone I was here." She smiled and raised something that looked like a knife. "It&#x2019;ll be our little secret."</p> <p>The news reports that aired later that night were confusing, to say the least. A married couple by the name of Carl and Lydia Scutner were found dead in their home, victims of an apparent murder-suicide. All evidence pointed to the fact that they were the suspects the police had been hunting for a while now, the monsters responsible for kidnapping and holding for ransom at least a dozen children from the suburbs of Chicago over the past six months. Small, fresh mounds of dirt in the backyard indicated that a few of those children had never been returned.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No cameras were allowed inside the house. Too gruesome, the police said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy was clearly still in shock. The descriptions he gave of what had happened&#x2014;the Scutners bursting into flames almost instantly, without burning a single other item in the house, only to self-extinguish a few minutes later&#x2014;were too ridiculous to be taken seriously. The police smiled politely at his tales and ruffled his hair, while his parents were so overcome with relief that they barely listened to a word he said. And the media, clearly of the opinion that children should be seen and not heard, were perfectly content to snap photo after photo of the adorable tear-stained lad, yanking the microphone out of his face the moment he started to embarrass them with talk of spontaneous magical fires.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one listened to him. And it was about that time that the child realized why the girl had told him to remain silent: because no one would have believed him anyway.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would have believed that his savior was merely a teenage girl wearing jeans and a plain black hoodie? Who would have believed that she simply appeared inside the house, set the Scutners ablaze with nothing more than a jab of her finger, and then disappeared just as quickly?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so he kept the little secret.</p> <p><b>2 </b><br>"Looks like Zara&#x2019;s at it again," the old bat&#x2019;s voice crackled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lex ignored this jolly piece of news and stared out the car window at the blurring foliage of the Adirondacks. The leaves were just beginning to change &#x2014; a few splotches of yellow, a speckle or two of red. Though a chill had settled in the air, she had opened her window far wider than just a crack, and neither the loud gusts of wind nor the occasional chattering of teeth issuing forth from the passengers stuffed into the tiny back seat had prompted her to close it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Keep it down, Pandora," Lex&#x2019;s uncle replied into his Cuff, the staticky, ether-infused communications device around his wrist. "I&#x2019;ve got rookies in the car. Don&#x2019;t freak them out any sooner than we have to."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is getting ridiculous!" the voice rasped back through the Cuff. "First those mail bombers in Houston, then that rapist in Nebraska. Now kidnappers in Chicago! Ever since that little snake found herself a new scythe, she&#x2019;s been going hog-wild!" There was a pause. "I guess we should count our lucky stars she hasn&#x2019;t come after us."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Count our lucky stars? She found a scythe, Dora. Which means she also found an ally."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which means," Pandora added, "that once again, we&#x2019;re screwed eight ways from Sunday."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They exchanged a few more words before hanging up. Uncle Mort glanced at Lex&#x2019;s twitching eye, then turned his attention back to the road and absent-mindedly ran his finger up and down the scar across his face. "You okay?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was precisely the forty-third time since they had left her parents&#x2019; house in Queens that Uncle Mort had asked her this. Lex had been keeping track.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don&#x2019;t know, are <i>you</i> okay?" she shot back, also for the forty-third time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After her twin sister&#x2019;s funeral in New York City, Lex and Uncle Mort had gotten back in his cheddar yellow &#x2019;74 Gremlin and taken off on a road trip to fetch the rookies. And ever since they left, Lex had turned into such a jittery pile of nerves that she&#x2019;d chewed through no less than fifty packs of gum. The constant supply of truck-stop coffees probably wasn&#x2019;t helping, either.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just couldn&#x2019;t turn off her brain. It toiled and hummed like a factory, ceaselessly churning out worries and concerns and the dreaded what-ifs. It never quit&#x2014;not when they stopped for food, not when they&#x2019;d gained two new passengers, not even when she slept. Or didn&#x2019;t sleep, in her case. Most nights she just stared at the dingy hotel ceilings and picked at her long, dark hair, replaying what had happened, worrying about her sister, wondering what would happen now that they were almost back in Croak.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the car, she began compulsively flicking the cheap plastic lighter decorated with a skull and crossbones that Uncle Mort had bought her at a truck stop somewhere in Ohio. She was thankful that they were together, at least; Uncle Mort could be a pain sometimes, but in the way she imagined an older brother would be&#x2014;annoying, but protective. And with the added benefit of being a total badass.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ran a hand through his black, electrocution-style hair, then shot her another concerned look and leaned over. "Do you need to stop?" he said in a quieter voice, in a tone that suggested he wasn&#x2019;t talking about urinary demands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Lex shrank in her seat a little. "I . . . discharged back in Buffalo."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good girl. Should only be another hour or so, okay?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lex sank farther into her standard-issue, thermoregulated black hoodie and pulled the hood over her head. The thought of having to discharge&#x2014;even the ugliness of the word itself&#x2014;made her feel so <i>diseased</i>. Fittingly, a hospital flew by her window just then, its stark concrete fa�ade mocking her copious dysfunctions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought back to where she&#x2019;d been nearly three months earlier: on her way to Croak for the first time with a rap sheet so long and terrible that her fed-up parents had decided to send her away for the summer to live with her uncle, in the hopes that he&#x2019;d straighten her out. Of course, they&#x2019;d had no idea that his idea of straightening her out meant informing her that she was a Grim and proceeding to give her a crash course on how to reap mortal souls. Not exactly the kind of thing one can describe in a pamphlet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had started out so well, though. For the first time in years, Lex made friends; hell, she even snagged a boyfriend. And true, she didn&#x2019;t agree with everything the Grimsphere stood for&#x2014;letting murderers go free without punishment was at the top of her list, and she&#x2019;d had more than a few urges to deliver her own idea of justice&#x2014;but overall, it was turning out to be the best summer of her life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until it all turned into a steaming pile of crap. The abnormal abilities that at first had turned her into the best Killer in Croak soon morphed into something much more sinister: the ability to Damn souls, a foul, unspeakable act that resulted in everlasting torment. And before she could even figure this out for herself, Zara&#x2014;a fellow Junior, a Grim-in-training&#x2014;jumped right in to twist it to her own advantage. Not only did Zara murder almost a hundred people under the radar all summer long, but she also devised a way to Cull Lex&#x2019;s Damning ability for herself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did this by using Lex&#x2019;s twin sister, Cordy, as bait.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lex had fallen for it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wave of nausea arose yet again. Lex bent over to pick through the bag at her feet, her sister&#x2019;s old backpack. In it sat a few clothes and Cordy&#x2019;s old stuffed octopus, Captain Wiggles, along with two items Uncle Mort had invented just for Lex: a Lifeglass&#x2014;an hourglass-shaped device that stored and recorded all her memories&#x2014;and a Spark, a flickering glass bulb that measured her life force. The Spark he&#x2019;d made for Cordy was in there too, although it was just a bright, glowing ball now&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lex gulped another breath, sat back up, and closed her eyes. <i>This drive will be over soon,</i> she told herself. <i>You&#x2019;ll be home</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because despite everything that had happened, Croak was still her home, and she loved it. The quaint streets, the rolling hills, the complete and utter lack of a Starbucks&#x2014;all the things that she&#x2019;d initially hated about the small town, she now missed with a burning passion. Being a Grim, traveling through the mind-numbing space that was the ether, Killing targets, delivering their souls to the Afterlife&#x2014;it was what she was born to do, and Croak was where she belonged.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the citizens in it that were the problem. Very soon she&#x2019;d have to face the townspeople, whom she hadn&#x2019;t seen since Uncle Mort had whisked her out of town two weeks earlier. What could she possibly say to everyone? They must hate her for letting Zara escape with the ability to Damn whomever she wanted, wherever she wanted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, she&#x2019;d get to go back to the job she loved. She&#x2019;d get to see Driggs and be kept up until two in the morning by his incessant drumming. She&#x2019;d get to see her friends.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends that she&#x2019;d be putting in danger. And it wasn&#x2019;t as if things were going back to the way they were. She&#x2019;d have to be on her guard at all times. She&#x2019;d have to control her vengeful urges even more vigilantly now. She&#x2019;d have to find Zara and stop her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she&#x2019;d have to see Cordy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lex anxiously shoved the lighter into her pocket. She couldn&#x2019;t avoid her sister forever. Cordy was waiting for her, just on the other side of the great hereafter, and by now had undoubtedly learned that she was dead because her dumbass sister had been too stupid to realize she was being manipulated. Lex didn&#x2019;t know what to expect. A cold, unloving stare? The silent treatment? The angriest bitch slap of all time?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lex grabbed the handle and cranked the window down as far as it could go. She stuck her head out into the frigid air, letting the wind sting at her face, futilely hoping to numb her thoughts.</p></p><h2>Woodland Craft</h2><p><p><strong>Celebrate the splendor of wood with these wood-crafting projects.</strong> From simple woven panels to making a functional yurt, <strong><em>Woodland Craft</em></strong> features an array of easy-to-follow projects that include crafts for the farm, garden, wood fuel, building and domestic use.&nbsp; <strong>Green wood &#x2013; wood that has been recently cut and is therefore still moisture-rich &#x2013; is the predominant material used in the projects featured in this essential guide for craftsman of all levels.</strong></p> <p>With <strong><em>Woodland Craft:</em></strong></p> <ul> <li><strong> you'll learn all you need to know about tools and devices, both old and new. </strong></li> <li><strong>you&#x2019;ll browse through the directory of tree species and identify the best uses for each.</strong></li> <li><strong>you&#x2019;ll gain the insight you need to make practically anything out of this clean, crisp, beautiful element.</strong></li> <li><strong>Includes 700 illustrations and photographs</strong> </li> </ul></p><p><p>Ben Law, woodsman, craftsman, eco-builder, teacher and writer, lives and works in Prickly Nut Wood in West Sussex, UK.

The destruction of Jerusalem was impending and many of the believers believed the end of the world was near. However, Paul warned the church against entertaining a false hope, for he knew they were misguided with their beliefs. It was a critical time-the apostles were passing away, and soon the church would be left alone. It was in this hour of perplexity that the book of Hebrews appeared with needed light and comfort. The people needed a clear conception of the work Christ was doing for them in the courts above, and this book explained the delay in His return, and restored their wavering faith. The conditions and problems which the church then had to meet are not unlike those facing the church today. While the early church was living at the time of the fulfillment of the first part of Christ&#39;s prophecy-the destruction of the city of Jerusalem and the temple, we are living at the time of the fulfillment of the second part of the prophecy-the coming of the Lord Jesus in the clouds of heaven. As there was misconceptions of Christ&#39;s work in the sanctuary then, so there are those now who likewise err. There is as much need today of a thorough study of the Scriptures as there was then, and more so. The book of Hebrews was a great factor in stabilizing the apostolic church in the crisis hour before the fall of Jerusalem, and it is hoped that a discussion of the mighty themes of the book of Hebrews will be of some help to the church of God today. All need to have their eyes fastened on our great High Priest and the work He is doing in the sanctuary above. And may it be the blessed privilege of many with &#34;boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.&#34; (Heb. 10:19, 20.) This was the prayer and hope of the author of Hebrews, and this also is the hope of the author of this volume.</p><p></p><h2>The Lovecraft Anthology: Volume 2</h2><p><p>A graphic anthology of tales featuring collaborations between established writers and artists and debut contributors, <i>The Lovecraft Anthology</i> showcases Lovecraft&#x2019;s talent for the macabre.

The various adaptors and artists are from the United States and Europe.</p>The second passel of Lovecraft adaptations by European comics creators is a mite more successful than the first. The artwork, as strong as in the earlier collection, again looks fundamentally like Mike Mignola&#x2019;s Hellboy, with its restricted palette and dark-but-definite contrast, and this time no script is tripped up by Lovecraft&#x2019;s overwrought vocabulary and imagery. The tales chosen for rendering are all minor Lovecraft, though &#x201c;Pickman&#x2019;s Model,&#x201d; about an artist of the horrific, is a fan favorite, and Attila Futaki&#x2019;s tr�s murky portrayal of &#x201c;The Nameless City,&#x201d; so reminiscent of the great Czech animator Jan &#x160;vankmajer&#x2019;s creepiest films&#x2014;Faust, Little Otik&#x2014;is something special, indeed. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Needles and Pearls: A Novel</h2><p>The warm and witty sequel to <em>The Beach Street Knitting Society and Yarn Club</em><br><br> Slip one . . .<br>Two weddings and a year after her husband's funeral, Jo Mackenzie is finally starting to get the hang of being a single parent.

(Author's name is pronounced "Jill.")The sequel to The Beach Street Knitting Society and Yarn Club (2009) opens on the one-year anniversary of the death of Nick, Jo Mackenzie&#x2019;s unfaithful husband and the father of her two boys, Jack and Archie. Jo is forced to endure her in-laws for a trip to Nick&#x2019;s grave, but otherwise things are looking up: both her grandmother and her best friend are newly engaged, and Jo is still happily working in her grandmother&#x2019;s yarn shop and running the &#x201c;Stitch and Bitch&#x201d; club. There&#x2019;s even a potential love interest in the picture: Martin, the handsome but awkward son of a woman who works at the yarn shop with Jo. But the budding romance&#x2014;and Jo&#x2019;s life overall&#x2014;is turned on its head when Jo finds out she&#x2019;s pregnant as a result of a one-night stand with a photographer in Venice. Readers looking for a tightly woven story might be frustrated by the many scenes of Jo&#x2019;s kids acting up, but overall this is a fun follow-up to McNeil&#x2019;s first entry. --Kristine Huntley</p><h2>The Disappearing L: Erasure of Lesbian Spaces and Culture (SUNY series in Queer Politics and Cultures)</h2><p><i>Investigates the rise and fall of US American lesbian cultural institutions since the 1970s.</i><br><br>2018 Over the Rainbow Selection, presented by the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgendered Round Table (GLBTRT) of the American Library Association<br><br>LGBT Americans now enjoy the right to marry&#x2015;but what will we remember about the vibrant cultural spaces that lesbian activists created in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s? Most are vanishing from the calendar&#x2015;and from recent memory. <i>The Disappearing L</i> explores the rise and fall of the hugely popular women-only concerts, festivals, bookstores, and support spaces built by and for lesbians in the era of woman-identified activism. Through the stories unfolding in these chapters, anyone unfamiliar with the Michigan festival, Olivia Records, or the women&#x2019;s bookstores once dotting the urban landscape will gain a better understanding of the era in which artists and activists first dared to celebrate lesbian lives. This book offers the backstory to the culture we are losing to mainstreaming and assimilation. Through interviews with older activists, it also responds to recent attacks on lesbian feminists who are being made to feel that they&#x2019;ve hit their cultural expiration date.</p><p><p>Bonnie J.

This book is so rich, so wonderful, so enormous an undertaking, and so well written that it is hard to describe what a treasure it is ... <i>The Disappearing L</i> should be included in every history course in high schools and universities.

This book shines a light on the miracle we all created.&#x201d; &#x2015; <i>Lesbian Connection</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Disappearing L</i> is both an &#x2018;insider&#x2019; story and a well-written analysis of a neglected piece of cultural history.

Eighty days or so into the trip, Moitessier and Marie-Th�r�se found themselves on the reef at Diego Garcia.<br><br>It took Moitessier just nine months to build Marie-Th�r�se II from scratch in Mauritius with no boat plans or power tools. From her launch he sailed her down to South Africa. His observations during a stay of almost two years are as interesting as the people he met and the innovative boat improvements he came up with. Unfortunately, he and Marie-Th�r�se II managed to end up on the rocks near St. Vincent in the Caribbean.<br><br>In between these two heartbreaking disasters is a tale of courage, resourcefulness, and creativity. It is told with refreshing honesty, in which Moitessier, still really an apprentice sailor, admits his blunders.

He lives on a farm in South Africa.</p><p>Illustrator: Adrienne Kennaway moved from Kenya to London when she was 15 to study at the Ealing School of Art. Later she attended L'Academia de Belle Arte in Rome. It was on her return to Kenya that she began illustrating the picture books that have made her well known.</p>In his attempt to snare a hare, Leopard enlists the help of Baboon. She is to monitor the rabbit hole while Leopard takes a drink from the river. But the cunning prey digs himself another exit and escapes. As Baby Baboon observes this comedic scene from his tree branch, he laughs and laughs--until he provokes the angry hunger of Leopard--"I'll have you to eat instead." When he snags Baby Baboon by the tail, Vervet Monkey intercedes with a clever scheme to save the impetuous youngster: reasoning that baboons are notoriously tough to eat, she suggests a spurious tenderizing method. The powerful Leopard is foiled by his credulity when Baby Baboon flies high through the air and is caught in his mother's arms. So, to this day, we can hear Baby Baboon laughing and laughing as Leopard hangs in the tree waiting. The classic simplicity and sly playfulness of Hadithi's narrative and Kennaway's exotic, light-sensitive watercolors make this attractive volume a worthy addition to the team's growing library of pourquoi tales ( Lazy Lion , Hot Hippo , Crafty Chameleon ).

More than a literary text with critical commentary, it constitutes an event of central significance for contemporary philosophical, literary, and political concerns.The book consists of <i>The Instant of My Death,</i> a powerful short prose piece by Blanchot, and an extended essay by Derrida that reads it in the context of questions of literature and of bearing witness. Blanchot's narrative concerns a moment when a young man is brought before a firing squad during World War II and then suddenly finds himself released from his near death. The incident, written in the third person, is suggestively autobiographical&#x2014;from the title, several remarks in the text, and a letter Blanchot wrote about a similar incident in his own life&#x2014;but only insofar as it raises questions for Blanchot about what such an experience might mean. The accident of near death becomes, in the instant the man is released, the accident of a life he no longer possesses. The text raises the question of what it means to write about a (non)experience one cannot claim as one's own, and as such is a text of testimony or witness.Derrida's reading of Blanchot links the problem of testimony to the problem of the secret and to the notion of the instant. It thereby provides the elements of a more expansive reassessment of literature, testimony, and truth. In addressing the complex relation between writing and history, Derrida also implicitly reflects on questions concerning the relation between European intellectuals and World War II.</p><p>&#x201c;This is a very useful book because it makes Blanchot&#x2019;s powerful text widely available in both French and English.&#x201d;&#x2014;The European LegacyStanford has published two books by Maurice Blanchot: <i>Friendship</i> (1997) and <i>The Work of Fire</i> (1995). Stanford has published seven books by Jacques Derrida, most recently <i>Adieu to Emmanuel Levinas</i> (1999).</p><h2>Swoon: Great Seducers and Why Women Love Them</h2><p><p><strong>"Lose yourself: <em>Swoon</em> has wicked fun answering that age-old query: What do women want?"&#x2015;<em>Chicago Tribune</em></strong></p> Contrary to popular myth and dogma, the men who consistently beguile women belie the familiar stereotypes: satanic rake, alpha stud, slick player, Mr. Nice, or big-money mogul. As Betsy Prioleau, author of <em>Seductress</em>, points out in this surprising, insightful study, legendary ladies&#x2019; men are a different, complex species altogether, often without looks or money. They fit no known template and possess a cache of powerful erotic secrets. <p>With wit and erudition, Prioleau cuts through the cultural lore and reveals who these master lovers really are and the arts they practice to enswoon women. What she discovers is revolutionary. Using evidence from science, popular culture, fiction, anthropology, and history, and from interviews with colorful real-world ladykillers, Prioleau finds that great seducers share a constellation of unusual traits.</p><p>While these men run the gamut, they radiate joie de vivre, intensity, and sex appeal; above all, they adore women. They listen, praise, amuse, and delight, and they know their way around the bedroom. And they&#x2019;ve finessed the hardest part: locking in and revving desire. Women never tire of these fascinators and often, like Casanova&#x2019;s conquests, remain besotted for life.</p><p>Finally, Prioleau takes stock of the contemporary culture and asks: where are the Casanovas of today? After a critique of the twenty-first-century sexual malaise&#x2015;the gulf between the sexes and women&#x2019;s record discontent&#x2015;she compellingly argues that society needs ladies&#x2019; men more than ever. Groundbreaking and provocative, <em>Swoon</em> is underpinned with sharp analysis, brilliant research, and served up with seductive verve.</p> 12 illustrations</p><p>Betsy Prioleau is the author of Seductress and Circle of Eros and was a scholar in residence at New York University where she taught cultural history.

In this slightly expanded version of a 1984 book, with enlarged illustrations, a merry, chaotic family of mice set out for a picnic in their red pickup. As they bounce along the bumpy dirt road, Little Bitty falls off the back of the truck. Accompanied only by a pink stuffed animal, Bitty cries a little, forages a little, and waits a little. Meanwhile, the parents discover that Bitty is missing, and all the mice search the picnic site frantically, pile into the truck, and then head back down the road, where they find her waiting. Every child who has felt lost, even for a moment, will savor the happy reunion. Page layout varies from broad, double-page paintings of a single scene to several smaller pictures on a white page. Defined by McCully's precise, energetic line drawings and brightened with washes in warm, rich colors, the ink-and-watercolor artwork will appeal to children and adults alike. With a short text and sun-dappled illustrations, this book captures the feeling of the best summer days: so joyful, so splendid that even the sad tale of a little lost mouse is sure to end happily. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He lives in Dallas, Texas. This is his first book.<b><br></b>1<br> &nbsp;<br> Combat on the Siegfried Line<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the 25th of January, and we were more than twenty cold and miserable recruits in each truck, bouncing around in our replacement convoy. We had begun losing trucks as one or two turned away to follow faint tracks that paralleled signal corps&#x2019; wire strung everywhere. A convoy of huge 155mm Long Tom cannons passed us on their way somewhere&#x2014;maybe going north to support Patton as he helped squeeze the Germans from the Bulge. As for me, I sat and shivered uncontrollably like everyone else, alternating my Hail Marys and Our Fathers with memorizing the serial number of my second- or third-hand M1 rifle. Why is it that half a century later I can remember &#x201c;2506819,&#x201d; but can recall so few faces of the men I knew?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No conversation took place other than short exclamations of acute discomfort or to pronouncements of the need to remove a leg wedged between someone&#x2019;s pack and another man&#x2019;s rear end. Occasionally, a man desperate to relieve himself would pick his way to the tailgate. With one hand holding on to the seat back and the other digging out his penis, he would cause the truck following to back off a bit.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before dark, our truck and one other pulled over, and a white-clad man materialized out of the snow, barking for everyone to fall out on the roadside. Stiff-bodied, groaning recruits dropped by twos from the lowered tailgate; many sank to their knees, unable to stand after the cramped accommodations. We were told to toss our barracks bags in a three-quarter-ton truck. Finally, we struggled into line and began moving through the snow as the trucks backed around. The men watched the trucks take off the way they had come.<br> &nbsp;<br> The snow absorbed most sounds and made our voices sound strange. We had not seen any sunlight since Scotland. It was difficult to pick our way along the wheel ruts of the occasional traffic passing us&#x2014;the gray light made everything look flat and foreboding. We knew where the road lay buried by following the strands of communication wire strung from trees, poles, and fence posts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Noncoms (noncommissioned officers&#x2014;corporals and sergeants) fielded questions from the curious, newly arrived soldiers. Broken trees off in the fields appeared as gray silhouettes, along with the shapes of abandoned vehicles and tanks. The falling snow became heavier, and noncoms increased the distance between each of us about fifteen yards, so any shells hitting near would claim fewer of us.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was an obvious difference between the noncoms and us: Faces half-wrapped in scarves revealed raw, weather-beaten flesh. Their equipment and uniforms were caked in mud, but their weapons were clean.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sound of boots crunching through frozen snow was the only sound now. And then my heart almost stopped, as off to the right sudden stabs of yellow light shot skyward, followed by a terrific concussion of sound&#x2014;the loud, flat sound of cannon. Their projectiles made impressive rushing sounds as they climbed to the dusky overcast. We stumbled along, all eyes on the dimly seen guns and prime movers way off in a field bordered by woods. Some moments later, from miles to the north, came the sound of the shells detonating in several heavy and deep crumping sounds. This certainly brought home vividly the connection between our present location and the absolute certainty that the front line was near and that the German army was dug in three or four miles away. What could be a stronger introduction to the reality of what faced us than that demonstration?<br> &nbsp;<br> The question was forcibly answered within a couple of minutes. More artillery salvos off beyond a forest were followed by sounds of Crump! Crump! Crump! We stopped in our tracks to allow some self-propelled cannon to turn into a field. Farther on, we were introduced to the war&#x2019;s best cannon (not American), as the shells of 88s ripped through layers of wind and swirling air, constantly changing the pitch of sound. It was not unlike a great mile-long canvas being ripped from one end to the other by a giant hand. The shell from that long tube traveled like a rifle bullet; and depending on the distance of gun to target, from the moment it was first heard, a man had roughly a second or so to drop to the ground. But if the cannon was a few hundred yards away, its shell would arrive instantly, the sound of the cannon following the shell&#x2019;s impact in a double bang.<br> &nbsp;<br> This evening&#x2019;s introduction proved to be a mere demonstration as the shells traveled several miles and detonated a half mile or so to the rear. This was the two-second-warning variety, and noncoms had everyone up and moving as fast as legs would move through snow and the icy wheel ruts. The shells continued streaking by overhead for a time. Closer and louder thuds and flashes of light down the road toward the front increased this excitement. Moving toward this new revelation was an unpleasant sensation: It was one thing to have shells detonate to the rear, but to be marching toward them was distinctly depressing, and men wondered whether they would be required to march directly into it. The shells dropping to the front were (according to one noncom) 120mm mortars, the largest of either army.<br> &nbsp;<br> Several brilliant explosions close together revealed a town several hundred yards ahead, and our line was stopped and ordered fifty yards or so off the road. I found a seat on the ice-encrusted running board of what had been a truck. If the shelling moved up the road toward us, I could burrow underneath this rusting remnant. The other men squatted, watching a building on fire through the snow. There we remained until the shelling suddenly stopped.<br> &nbsp;<br> The noncom hesitated a minute before shouting instructions that if the shelling would resume, once in among the houses, we should take cover in the nearest building and then form up on the street the moment it would stop. He added that he was responsible for everyone, and anyone getting lost would answer to him.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the road, we doubled-timed into town along with traffic, which was moving again. This was the first German town that I ever was in, with France and Luxembourg a few miles to the rear; the town was Wochern. We moved along past trucks and jeeps in the street, and others were parked beside buildings and down side streets. Soldiers were moving in and out of houses and barns as they unloaded trucks. A wall stopped one tarp-covered six-by-six so that other traffic could get by. The six-by-six was pointed in the direction that we had just come from, and as I moved along between it and the wall, I saw GI boots stretching out of the back. I did a double take, because in the dim light it took a few seconds for me to realize that these were the mud-caked boots of dead soldiers. One limb was black, shriveled, and footless. The next man behind me closed up and I indicated to him what I had just seen. He turned to look, gagged, and then vomited against the wall as the line of replacements tried to squeeze past him. This was another graphic introduction to no-man&#x2019;s-land.<br> &nbsp;<br> After this sudden glimpse at the reality of what we were getting into, we were assembled in a courtyard in front of a building that may have been a school. We were told to drop our packs in the snow and to file inside a large room with olive drab blankets over the windows. A lamp illuminated the interior. Following us in was a tall, thin officer who identified himself as a chaplain and informed us we were part of the 94th Infantry Division, XX Corps, Third U.S. Army, with Gen. George Patton commanding. We were going to line companies of the 302d Regiment. He told us the expected, &#x201c;Come to me with any problems you might have,&#x201d; and then he proceeded with a brief history of the division including its training and combat record. He kept it brief, and then another officer broke us down into groups; noncoms led their group out to where we assembled at our packs. We were told to locate our barracks bags in the truck and bring them to our packs. We were to stow most of our gear in the bag and were told what to carry with us to our rifle company command posts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then our group followed a noncom to a house a few streets from our briefing. This was the command post of G Company. We entered from the rear into a stove-heated cellar. There, sitting at a table illuminated with candles, sergeants and a couple of officers were smoking. Men were sitting or sleeping on shelter halves on the floor. Gear and overshoes were scattered everywhere, with weapons leaning against the wall. The men at the table looked us over. They asked us when we had last eaten and took us out again to a barn in the rear.<br> &nbsp;<br> The barn&#x2019;s interior was also warm and filled with the smell of food and kerosene. We had dropped our packs in the cellar and had our mess kits at the ready. The cooks were friendly and generous with seconds. The food was hot and tasted good after the cold trip and march. While we washed out our kits in GI cans filled with hot water, one soapy and the other clean (or nearly so), we heard several explosions nearby&#x2014;six or eight in a row. A cook told us that regular shelling occurred most every day and night. The Germans knew this town was used as the regimental units&#x2019; headquarters, plus supply dumps for most everything except artillery shells. Often, mortar fragments hit men as they moved between buildings. The mortars dropped in without sound or warning, in contrast to the rounds of artillery shells that usually could be heard rushing in, giving a few seconds of warning before detonating.<br> &nbsp;<br> The hot food brought on drowsiness: But sleep would not come that night or the next. We were taken back to the cellar, grabbed our packs, and were led up some stairs to a room that was candlelit and the windows were covered with blankets. Two noncoms were there, one a platoon sergeant. Two of the replacements were here alone with the sergeants, and the other new men had gone elsewhere. I was told to trade my M1 for a BAR (Browning automatic rifle), but I took a risk by saying that I really wanted to carry the M1. The sergeant looked at me a moment, and I expected to lose the M1 and be given a reprimand, when the other replacement replied that he would take the BAR. That got me off the hook. He then asked whether we had been given orientation at regiment. We explained that we had been filled in on the division&#x2019;s Stateside training history and combat history in France. The sergeant then described exactly where we were located in Germany.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>A Nameless Witch</h2><p><p>A tale of vengeance, true love, and cannibalism</p><p>Being born undead can have its disadvantages, such as eternal youth and flawless beauty ---things most unsuitable for a witch.

Lee Martinez</b> lives in Terrell, Texas.</p><p><strong>Chapter One</strong>I was born dead. Or, to be more accurate, undead. Not that there is much difference between the two. It&#x2019;s just a matter of degrees really.When I say undead, I do not mean vampyre, ghoul, or graveyard fiend. There are many versions of unlife. These are only the most common. My state was far less debilitating. Bright lights bothered me to some noticeable degree, and I preferred my meat undercooked. Once reaching adulthood, I&#x2019;d become ageless. Most means of mortal harm could not truly hurt me, and I possessed a smattering of unusual gifts not known among the living. Yet all these advantages came at a high price.Exactly how I came to be born undead is a long, complicated story not really worth telling in detail. It involves my great-great-great-great-grandfather, a renowned hero of the realm, and his conflict with a dark wizard. This wizard, his name is lost to history so I just call him Nasty Larry for convenience&#x2019; sake, had raised an army of orcish zombies to ravage the land. Now everyone knows orcs are terrible things, and zombies aren&#x2019;t much fun either. Mix the two together and you get an evil greater than the sum of its parts. Naturally, a legion of heroes was assembled, and the requisite last stand against doomsday was fought and won by a hairsbreadth. My great-great-great-great-grandfather slew Nasty Larry, cleaving his head from his shoulders with one sweep of a mighty broadsword. Nasty Larry&#x2019;s head rolled to his slayer&#x2019;s feet and pronounced a terrible curse, as decapitated wizard&#x2019;s heads are prone to do.With my dying breath, I curse thee and thy bloodline. From now until the end of time, the sixth child of every generation shall be made a gruesome abomination. A twisted, horrible thing that shall shun the light and dwell in miserable darkness.That bit of business finished, Nasty Larry died. According to legend, he melted into a puddle, the sky turned black, and&#x2014;if one could believe such tales&#x2014;the land within a hundred miles turned to inhospitable swamp. That was the end of Nasty Larry&#x2019;s small, yet noteworthy, influence on my life.I often wondered why my parents chose to have a sixth child, being forewarned as they were. They had many excuses. The most common being, We lost count. Second common, and far more acceptable in my opinion, was, Well, none of our family had ever had six, and we thought it might not have taken. Perfectly reasonable. Not all curses grab hold, and one couldn&#x2019;t live one&#x2019;s life fretting over every utterance of every bodiless head one ran across.Being undead was not all that horrible a curse. Unfortunately, this was not the end of my worries. For besides being made a thing born to dwell in darkened misery, I was also made, in the infinite wisdom of fate, a girl. These two conditions taken individually were minor handicaps, but toss them together, and you would understand the difficulties I experienced growing up.There are kingdoms where a woman is prized for her mind, where she is more than a trophy or a poorly paid housemaid. Kingdoms where the chains of a thousand years of chauvinism have finally rusted away. I was not born in one of these kingdoms.I was not very popular among the male suitors of my village. It was nothing personal. Husbands just prefer living wives, and I met so few potential spouses locked in my parents&#x2019; basement. At the age of eighteen, I was already an old, undead maid sitting in a darkened cellar, waiting to die.Of course, I don&#x2019;t die. Not like normal people. Certainly, old age wouldn&#x2019;t accomplish the task. So I settled in for a very long wait. I figured it would be another fifty years before my parents died and one of my brothers or sisters would inherit caretaking duties of their poor, wretched sibling. One of their children would take over next. And so on. And so on. Until one day, they either forgot me, or all died, or maybe, just maybe, an angry mob would drag me from the shadows and burn me at the stake. Not much to look forward to. But no one is master of their fate, and my lot was not all that terrible in the end.All that changed with the arrival of Ghastly Edna. That wasn&#x2019;t her real name. I never learned it. I just called her Ghastly Edna because it seemed a proper witch&#x2019;s name. She was a grotesquely large woman, bearlike in proportions, with a pointed hat, a giant hooked nose, and a long, thin face. Her skin, while not truly green, possessed a slick olive hue. Her nose even had a wart. Ghastly Edna&#x2019;s only flaw, witchly speaking, was a set of perfectly straight, perfectly polished teeth.The day I met Ghastly Edna changed everything, and I remember it well. The basement door opened. I scrambled to the foot of the stairs to collect my daily meal. Instead, she came lumbering down. Her bulky frame clouded the light filtering behind her. She placed a callused hand under my chin and smiled thinly.Yes, yes. You shall do, child.Ghastly Edna purchased me from my parents for a puny sum. I&#x2019;m certain they were glad to be rid of their cursed daughter, and I couldn&#x2019;t honestly blame them. My new mentor whisked me away to her cottage in the middle of some forsaken woods far from civilization. The first thing she did was clean me up. It took six long hours to wash away the accumulated filth of eighteen years and cut the tangle of hair atop my head. When she finally finished, she stood me before a small mirror and frowned.No, no, no. I do not like this. I do not like this one bit.The effect this had on my self-esteem was immediate and crushing. I&#x2019;d always know myself to be a hideous thing. Yet Ghastly Edna was no prize beauty herself, and to evoke such a revolted tone could only mean that Nasty Larry&#x2019;s curse had really had its way with me.You&#x2019;re not ugly, child, she corrected. You&#x2019;re quite&#x2014;her long face squished itself into a scowl&#x2014;lovely.I had yet to dare look in the mirror for fear of being driven mad by own hideousness. Now I chanced a sidelong glance through the corner of my eye. It was not the sanity-twisting sight I had expected, but still a far cry from lovely.But what about these? I cupped the large, fatty mounds on my chest.Those are breasts, Ghastly Edna said. They&#x2019;re supposed to be there.But they&#x2019;re so... so...Round. Firm. She sighed. That&#x2019;s how they&#x2019;re supposed to be. Ideally.I found that hard to believe, but I wasn&#x2019;t about to argue with the person who&#x2019;d rescued me from my solitary existence.And that bottom of yours. She mumbled. You could bounce a gold piece off it.But the skin is pale, I offered, trying to please her.It&#x2019;s not pale, dear. It&#x2019;s alabaster. She circled me twice, looking more disappointed with each passing moment. And I don&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;ve ever seen eyes quite that shade of green. Or lips so full and soft. And your hair. I washed it with year-old soap, and it&#x2019;s still as soft as gossamer. She drew close and sniffed. And it smells of sunflowers.What about my teeth? Surely they&#x2019;re not supposed to look like that.She checked my gums and teeth with her fingers. No, dear. You&#x2019;re quite correct. They&#x2019;re a tad too sharp. But it&#x2019;s not an obvious flaw, and besides that, they&#x2019;re nice and white. Good gums too. The tongue has a little fork in it, but only if you&#x2019;re looking for it.She ordered me into a seat, still naked and slightly damp from the bath.Are you certain you spent all your life in that basement?I nodded.No exercise. Dismal diet. Dwelling in filth. Yet somehow you come out like this. Not even half-mad as far as I can tell.You mean, I&#x2019;m not cursed, ma&#x2019;am?Oh, you are cursed, child, and undead. That much is certain. Curses come in many forms however, and not all are as bad. Especially death curses. It&#x2019;s tricky enough to cast a decent spell when you&#x2019;re still alive. But throwing one out as you&#x2019;re expiring requires a certain knack. Apparently, the wizard who cursed your family was not as in control of his magic as he should&#x2019;ve been. The undead part came through, but the hideousness element didn&#x2019;t quite make it. The magic must&#x2019;ve had a better idea as it sometimes does.She handed me a towel. Cover yourself, dear. I can&#x2019;t bear to look upon you anymore.I did as I was told.That&#x2019;s the thing about death curses. One really shouldn&#x2019;t employ them unless one feels they can pull it off. It just makes the rest of us look bad.She spent several minutes rocking in her chair, mulling over the situation. A dread fell upon me. I didn&#x2019;t want to be sent back to my cellar if I could help it. Given no other choice, I&#x2019;d accepted my fate. Now my universe was filled with other possibilities, and I didn&#x2019;t want to lose them.Ghastly Edna snapped up from her chair.Well, dear, the magic called me to you. Far be it from me to contradict it. Your loveliness just means you&#x2019;ll have to work harder at your witchery. A handicap yes, but not an insurmountable one. She peeled the wart from her nose. False, darling. She winked.She proceeded to wipe the greenish makeup from her face to reveal skin that, while rough and haggard, was not especially hideous. She removed six layers of clothing to show that her hunch was nothing more than an illusion of well-placed fabric. When she removed her hat, I realized that Ghastly Edna was a large and ugly woman, but not at all witchly without her full outfit.We all need a little help, dear. You just need far more than I. Now let me see what I have here that might do the trick. She began digging through various moldy trunks filled with equally moldy clothing.My heart leaped with joy.Ghastly Edna spent the next six months acquainting me with the ins and outs of witchly wardrobe. Wearing just the right outfit was fifty percent of a witch&#x2019;s business, she explained. She was not exaggerating. It took a great deal of work to make one look as bad as was expected. Especially for me, my mentor pointed out, as I was afflicted with a form most unsuitable for a witch.Once I&#x2019;d mastered the art of looking witchly, she proceeded to teach me the black arts: necromancy, demonology, the forgotten language of unspeaking things, and forbidden nature lore. The powers of magic that had drawn Ghastly Edna to me had not been mistaken, and in due course, I mastered the cr...</p></p><h2>Suffering: A Test of Theological Method</h2><p>How can an omnipotent God allow suffering and violence to pervade the world? The author approaches this disturbing question by examining the concept of power. At opposing ends of a spectrum lie two powers--demonic power that is violent, destructive, and dominative, and the power of God that is creative, totally open, self-giving, and expansive.

Dog builds a robot. The two go to the library to get movies, and they make popcorn. They go to the beach, and the dog encourages the robot to play with him in the water. Robot is unable to move afterward because he has rusted stiff, and the dog finally leaves him there on his blanket on the sand. Seasons pass, and both Robot and Dog reflect on what happened, and both are changed because of this experience. The canine goes through a series of friendships that are unfulfilling in different ways: a duck goes south for the winter, a snowman melts, and the anteaters expect him to share their lunches. Meanwhile, the robot is lying on the beach, immobile but awake. He dreams of being rescued, of making new friends, of reuniting with Dog, of never having entered the water in the first place. While he dreams, his body is covered by sand and snow, is used for parts by scavengers, and even serves as a nesting place for a bird. This almost wordless (and dialogue-free) graphic novel is by turns funny and poignant. The cartoon artwork is clear and easy to understand. Varon uses a muted palette of earth tones with great skill. This book is like those board games that can be appreciated by anyone from 8 to 80.

But in 1997, in the face of personal crisis, he turned to his Jewish heritage for guidance. In his reading he happened upon a Jewish spiritual tradition called Mussar. Gradually he realized that he had stumbled upon an insightful discipline for self-development, complete with meditative, contemplative, and other well-developed transformative practices designed to penetrate the deepest roots of the inner life. <br><br>Eventually reaching the limits of what he could learn on his own, he decided to seek out a Mussar teacher. This was not an easy task, since almost the entire world of the Mussar tradition had been wiped out in the Holocaust. In time, he found an accomplished master who stood in an unbroken line of transmission of the Mussar tradition, and who lived in the center of a community of Orthodox Jews on Long Island. This book tells the story of Morinis&#x2019;s journey to meet his teacher and what he learned from him, revealing the central teachings and practices that are the spiritual treasury and legacy of Mussar.</p><p>How can a person be generous to the poor when his own bank account is almost empty? Mussar, a thousand-year-old Jewish spiritual tradition, offers answers to this and many other questions regarding the distance between religious ideals and everyday realities, as Alan Morinis explains in <i>Climbing Jacob's Ladder</i>. Morinis, a Canadian baby boomer who grew up to become a Rhodes Scholar, anthropologist, and film producer, discovered Mussar teachings at the low point of his midlife crisis. After he made some high-flying business deals that crashed, Morinis found reassurance in the Mussar idea that human life is holy and people can improve themselves. And Mussar, a system of ethical discipline conceived by Orthodox Jews to help them meet the demanding requirements of observant life, does seem perfectly designed for readers seeking step-by-step instruction for building or rebuilding their spiritual lives. In <i>Climbing Jacob's Ladder</i> Morinis tells the story of how he used Mussar to climb back up to holy life and invites readers to come along on his ascent. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Jewish by birth, though from a secular family, Alan Morinis took a deep journey into Hinduism and Buddhism as a young man. He received a doctorate for his study of Hindu pilgrimage, learned yoga in India with B. K. S. Iyengar, and attended his first Buddhist meditation course in the Himalayas in 1974. But in 1997, when his film career went off track and he reached for some spiritual oxygen, he felt inspired to explore his Jewish heritage. In his reading he happened upon a Jewish tradition of spiritual practice called Mussar. Gradually he realized he had stumbled on an insightful discipline for self-development, complete with meditative, contemplative, and other well-developed transformative practices designed to penetrate the deepest roots of the inner life. <br>Eventually reaching the limits of what he could learn on his own, he decided to seek out a Mussar teacher. That was not easily achieved, since almost the entire world of the Mussar tradition had been wiped out in the Holocaust. In time, he did find an accomplished master who stood in an unbroken line of transmission of the Mussar tradition, and who lived at the center of a community of Orthodox Jews on Long Island. This book tells the story of Morinis's journey to meet his teacher and what he learned from him, and reveals the central teachings and practices that are the spiritual treasury and legacy of Mussar. <br>Alan Morinis has written this book because the wisdom and practices that helped him so much have not penetrated the world beyond the confines of Orthodox Judaism, and may not be fully appreciated even there at this time. His hope is that Jews and non-Jews alike will find in Mussar a time-tested path of spiritualpractice that will help them discover the hidden radiance within.</p><h2>Sew a Modern Halloween: Make 15 Spooky Projects for Your Home</h2><p>Decorate your home for Halloween with projects made from 5 easy and stylish block motifs, including skulls, spiderwebs, and spooky eyes!

A leading documentary photographer who was active in the New York Photo League in the 1930s, Siskind moved beyond the social realism of his early work as he increasingly came to view photography as a visual language of signs, metaphors, and symbols&#x2014;the equivalent of poetry and music. Through the forties and ifties, he developed new techniques to photograph details and fragments of ordinary, commonplace materials. This radical new work transformed Siskind's image-making from straight photography to abstraction, from documentation to expressive art. His concern with shape, line, gesture, and the picture plane prompted immediate comparison with abstract expressionist painting, particularly with the art of Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell. It took some years for Siskind's unprecedented photography to gain full acceptance, but, by the 1970s, he was an acknowledged master, publishing and exhibiting widely. Siskind was also one of the founding donors who established the archive at the Center for Creative Photography.</p><p>Aaron Siskind's oeuvre is so original that it defies classification, and it has not received the sustained critical attention that it richly merits. In fact, there are no other books on Siskind currently in print. Aaron Siskind presents the first complete retrospective of this legendary photographer. It highlights important, rarely published bodies of work from Harlem; from Bucks County architecture; and from the "Tabernacle," "Gloucester," "Martha's Vineyard," "Louis Sullivan," and "Pleasures and Terrors of Levitation" photo series. The book also includes an introduction by Gilles Mora, an expert on modern American photography, and texts by critic and photographer Charles Traub. This study, based on the Siskind archives at the Center for Creative Photography and supported by the Aaron Siskind Foundation, fills a resounding editorial void around one of the most challenging and important figures in the art of American photography.</p></p><p>Gilles Mora is a photographic historian and the author or coauthor of studies of Walker Evans, Edward Weston, and W. Eugene Smith, among others. In 2010, the city of Montpellier, France, appointed him as artistic director of the Pavillon Populaire."A handsome new volume from the University of Texas Press that is the first retrospective in book form of Siskind's long career."

Though Grey trained as a dentist, he turned to writing as a career in 1904, when his first book was published. He went on to write more than 50 novels, most of them tales of adventure with a Western setting, including <i>The Last of the Plainsmen</i> (1908), <i>Riders of the Purple Sage</i> (1912), <i>The Thundering Herd</i> (1925), <i>Code of the West</i> (1934), and <i>West of the Pecos</i> (1937). His nonfiction works include <i>Tales of Fishing</i> (1925). Many of Grey's novels continue to be extremely popular, and several have been adapted into motion pictures.[Grey] had the knack of tying his characters into the land, and the land into the story. There were other Eastern writers who had fast and furious action, but Zane Grey was the one who could make the action not only convincing but inevitable, and somehow you got the impression that the bigness of the country generated a bigness of character. --Erle Stanley Gardner</p><h2>Strega Nona&#39;s Magic Ring (A Strega Nona Book)</h2><p>Big Anthony gets what he <i>thinks </i>he wants&#x2014;but like usual, it causes him more trouble than he can handle in this beloved sequel to Tomie dePaola&#x2019;s Caldecott Honor&#x2013;winning <i>Strega Nona</i>.<br><br>Big Anthony has a case of spring fever and he needs a little Night Life to cheer him up!<br> <br>But Big Anthony is afraid that if he goes to the village dance, no one will dance with him.

Alan Wallace reveals the theoretical similarities underlying these disparate disciplines and their unified approach to making sense of the objective world. <br><br>Wallace begins by exploring the relationship between Christian and Buddhist meditative practices. He outlines a sequence of meditations the reader can undertake, showing that, though Buddhism and Christianity differ in their belief systems, their methods of cognitive inquiry provide similar insight into the nature and origins of consciousness. <br><br>From this convergence Wallace then connects the approaches of contemporary cognitive science, quantum mechanics, and the philosophy of the mind. He links Buddhist and Christian views to the provocative philosophical theories of Hilary Putnam, Charles Taylor, and Bas van Fraassen, and he seamlessly incorporates the work of such physicists as Anton Zeilinger, John Wheeler, and Stephen Hawking. Combining a concrete analysis of conceptions of consciousness with a guide to cultivating mindfulness and profound contemplative practice, Wallace takes the scientific and intellectual mapping of the mind in exciting new directions.</p><p>By establishing a dialogue in which the meditative practices of Buddhism and Christianity speak to the theories of modern philosophy and science, B.

But they quickly realize that they are not the first visitors to the garden today. </p><p> There's a slimy trail on a leaf in the cucumber patch, and some corn kernels have been pecked off the cob. Not only that, someone has been snacking on the lettuce leaves!

The children who lead the adventure are new, but the format follows that of the other titles in the series that began with <i>In the Woods: Who's Been Here? </i>(1995): two children explore a natural place and wonder about the animals that have passed through. Here, the natural world is a backyard garden, where siblings Christina and Jeremy collect vegetables. As they find signs of animal interlopers in the chewed leaves and missing corn kernels, they wonder, "Who's been here?" George provides the answers on interspersed spreads that feature beautiful close-ups of the animal culprits, nibbling away. Young children will be easily drawn in by the detailed, realistic watercolor-and-ink illustrations of the plants and animals (the rendering of the children is slightly more awkward) and by the smooth text and its rhythmic refrain. A final page features postage-stamp-size images of each animal, accompanied by paragraphs offering more basic information. A fine introduction to common critters and the origins of common foods. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Built in in the two decades following World War II, it was the most successful of the high-speed X-planes. The only recently broken &#39;sound barrier&#39; was smashed completely by the X-15, which could hit Mach 6.7 and soar to altitudes above 350,000ft, beyond the edge of space. Several pilots qualified as astronauts by flying above 50 miles altitude in the X-15, including Neil Armstrong, the first man on the Moon. The three X-15s made 199 flights, testing new technologies and techniques which greatly eased America&#39;s entry into manned space travel, and made the Apollo missions and Space Shuttle viable propositions. With historical photographs and stunning digital artwork, this is the story of arguably the greatest of the X-Planes.</p><p><b>Peter E. Davies</b> has written or co-written nineteen books on modern American combat aircraft, including the standard reference work on US Navy and Marine Corps Phantom II operations, <i>Gray Ghosts</i>. He is based in Bristol, UK."North American X-15 by Osprey is another fascinating book for modelers, aerospace-oriented enthusiasts, and historians of the X-Plane era. It is full of highly detailed text and first-hand accounts by the pilots." - <i>KitMaker Network</i></p><h2>Horologion: The Daylight and Nocturnal Prayers of the Canonical Hours</h2><p>This is a bilingual edition of the Devotions, and Prayers of the Canonical Hours. Basically of monastic origin, the rich heritage of selected Psalms, Gospels, Epistles, Petitions and Absolutions that correspond to the life and Passion of our Lord, was actually incorporated into Christian worship at first by the Church of Alexandria. It was then adopted by many churches in the west particularly in France and Italy in the early decades of the 6th century A.D. Throughout the years it has become obvious that the origin of the Horologion which is deeply rooted in desert devotional supplications has kept this office of prayer and psalmody in its purest for in addition to the overall Officium of fasting, private prayer, night vigil, silence and contrition of heart.</p><p>Fayek M. Ishak was born at Godayida Sharkia and spent his childhood in the heart of the Nile Delta on a farm until he was nearly twelve years old.

In Brigitte, we see how the ideals of love and companionship are stifled in the presence of a self-righteous woman whose austere religious principals lead her to interfere--disastrously--in the lives of others. One by one the unwitting victims fall prey to the bleakness of her "perfection." A conscientious schoolteacher, a saintly priest, her husband and stepdaughter and an innocent schoolboy are all confronted with tragedy and upheaval. But the author's extraordinary gift for psychological insight goes on to show how redeeming features inevitably surface from disaster. The unfolding drama is seen through the discerning eye of a young Louis--Brigitte's stepson--whose point of view is skillfully blended into the mature and understanding adult he later becomes.</p><p><b>Fran�ois Mauriac</b> (1885-1970) was a French novelist, dramatist, critic, poet, and journalist, a member of the Acad�mie fran�aise, and laureate of the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the L�gion d'honneur in 1958.</p><h2>Lipstick Jihad: A Memoir of Growing up Iranian in America and American in Iran</h2><p>As far back as she can remember, Azadeh Moaveni has felt at odds with her tangled identity as an Iranian-American. In suburban America, Azadeh lived in two worlds. At home, she was the daughter of the Iranian exile community, serving tea, clinging to tradition, and dreaming of Tehran. Outside, she was a California girl who practiced yoga and listened to Madonna. For years, she ignored the tense standoff between her two cultures. But college magnified the clash between Iran and America, and after graduating, she moved to Iran as a journalist. This is the story of her search for identity, between two cultures cleaved apart by a violent history. It is also the story of Iran, a restive land lost in the twilight of its revolution. <br> Moaveni's homecoming falls in the heady days of the country's reform movement, when young people demonstrated in the streets and shouted for the Islamic regime to end. In these tumultuous times, she struggles to build a life in a dark country, wholly unlike the luminous, saffron and turquoise-tinted Iran of her imagination. As she leads us through the drug-soaked, underground parties of Tehran, into the hedonistic lives of young people desperate for change, Moaveni paints a rare portrait of Iran's rebellious next generation. The landscape of her Tehran &#x2014; ski slopes, fashion shows, malls and cafes &#x2014; is populated by a cast of young people whose exuberance and despair brings the modern reality of Iran to vivid life.</p><p><b>Azadeh Moaveni</b> grew up in San Jose and studied politics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She won a Fulbright fellowship to Egypt, and studied Arabic at the American University in Cairo. For three years she worked across the Middle East as a reporter for <i>Time Magazine</i>, before joining the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> to cover the war in Iraq. She lives in Beirut.Like characters in a play whose first act takes place in the lush summer and whose second act is set against barren winter trees, Iranians have spent the last quarter-century defining themselves against the contrasting backdrops of pre- and post-1979 Iran. Those who stayed in Iran after the Islamic revolution are faced with its consequences every day; those who fled the country are only somewhat more removed. Haunted by loss (of loved ones, of fortunes, of social networks) and sometimes by guilt (for supporting the shah or the revolution too blindly, or for staying too much out of the fray), many have spent these 26 years licking their wounds and mourning their old lives. <p>It has fallen largely to the younger generation to analyze this experience for Western readers. With a few exceptions, the recent crop of Iran memoirs has been written by women who were children when the revolution struck. Now in their twenties and thirties, they are fluent in English but still conversant in their parents' language, able to explain the intricate latticework of Persian society in the easy, often self-deprecating style of the American autobiography.</p><p>Lipstick Jihad, by Azadeh Moaveni, and Even After All This Time, by Afschineh Latifi, offer two versions of this, one of which works better than the other. For Latifi, an Iranian-born New York attorney, Iran switched from dream to nightmare when her father, a colonel in the shah's army, was executed after the revolution. Goodbye to BMWs, swimming clubs and a happy, secure family; hello to relatives seeking to marry off the preteen Latifi sisters to uneducated villagers while angling for the family's remaining assets. The sisters were sent abroad, but Europe and America proved in some ways as traumatic as what they had fled. Eventually they found professional success and were reunited with their mother and brothers in the United States.</p><p>Latifi's story is emblematic of many immigrants' experiences -- the fashion faux pas, the English learned from "The Brady Bunch" -- but her book often reads like a litany of these experiences instead of a distillation of them. She seems to have recorded every scene she can remember from her life, in faithful order, giving each equal weight -- a technique that may work in a legal document but feels diffuse in a memoir. She records the date of each sibling's and parent's birthday, provides a staggering 113 family snapshots, and includes minutiae about short-term jobs and law school parties that seem unrelated to the book's themes. Yet the scene in which her mother reveals to her brothers how their father died, years after the fact, gets only a page and is summed up with "there was a great deal of crying in the house that night." </p><p>At age 9, Latifi was told that the revolution was engineered by the "intensely fanatical . . . fundamentalist mujahedeen"; as she grew older, she didn't examine it much beyond that. If she ever reflected, during her lonely teenage exile, on why the uprising was so popular, if she ever felt ambivalence about her family's former privileged position or anger at her father's tragic refusal to flee, these feelings are trumped by loyalty to her parents, whose absence of flaws in her eyes makes them lack dimension as characters. Latifi's view of Iran is black and white, and a quick trip back there at the end of the book doesn't add nuance; after she and her mother have trouble at a hotel because they are unaccompanied women, she laments that "these people have ruined Iran" and hurries back to New York. </p><p> Azadeh Moaveni was born in 1976 into an Iranian expatriate community in northern California that similarly viewed Iran as "a place of light, poetry and nightingales" taken over by "a dark, evil force called the Revolution." As a child she absorbed these "distorting myths of exile," and as a teenager she added her own cultural identity crises to the brew. But having missed the revolution herself, Moaveni grew up less encumbered by the history that weighed on the adults around her, and when she decided to try living and working as a journalist in Tehran, she became a conduit for Iranians and Westerners to gain new perspectives on the country.</p><p>She arrived in 2000, when Iran's reformists had started to lose their teeth and their rock-star appeal and the conservatives had eased up on sartorial restrictions while continuing their assault on political freedoms. Moaveni is part of Iran's largest generation, the two-thirds of the country who are under 30 and are more interested in the latest rhinoplasty surgeons and bloggers than in the university's Friday prayer sessions. Some there saw her as a foreigner, and some considered her a wash-up for still being unmarried at 24, but on the whole she blended in with other Iranians and joined in their complex relationship with a country that evokes both fierce love and utter despair from its inhabitants. Years of civil rights abuses make Iranians "dream more modestly," but the criminalization of sexuality makes them crackle with sexual energy. Teenagers in 5-inch heels use martyrs' holidays as an excuse to throw make-out parties; disillusioned matrons trade Islam for yoga; mullahs who rail against "bourgeois" miniature poodles try to get Moaveni's cell phone number for a date. </p><p>Lipstick Jihad's sensational-sounding title is in fact apt. It refers to Iranians who, despite the regime's dictates, insist on what Moaveni calls an "as if" lifestyle, living as if it were permitted to "speak your mind, challenge authority . . . wear too much lipstick." Women especially engage every day in this "slow, deliberate, widespread act of defiance. A jihad, in the classical sense of the word: a struggle." </p><p>Moaveni has a journalist's eye for that struggle and a memoirist's knack for finding meaning in her own internal conflicts. For her, living in Iran meant inhabiting the "what if" world she might have grown up in, the oft-imagined world made flesh. Much of the time she felt alienated by it, but she writes affectingly of a moment in which her two worlds converged, on a ski slope when a friend used a Farsi term for "dear" that Moaveni recalled from the Iranians in California. "Until then, I had believed smells were the keys that unlocked memory, uniquely able to transport you back to some distant point in the past, in a heady flash. . . . But when I heard the word aziz, that endearment woven into the fabric of my childhood . . . I melted like a cat picked up by the scruff of its neck." </p><p>Despite such moments, Moaveni eventually abandoned the struggle to live in Iran. But her journey there provides a welcome alternative to the dark/light vision of it she grew up with. Her book shows us what Iran looks like in spring and fall, with all those seasons' biting winds and unexpected days of sunshine.</p><p>Reviewed by Tara Bahrampour <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

(Loeb Classical Library No. 405)</h2><p><p>Plutarch (Plutarchus), ca. 45&#x2013;120 CE, was born at Chaeronea in Boeotia in central Greece, studied philosophy at Athens, and, after coming to Rome as a teacher in philosophy, was given consular rank by the emperor Trajan and a procuratorship in Greece by Hadrian. He was married and the father of one daughter and four sons. He appears as a man of kindly character and independent thought, studious and learned.</p><p>Plutarch wrote on many subjects. Most popular have always been the 46 <i>Parallel Lives</i>, biographies planned to be ethical examples in pairs (in each pair, one Greek figure and one similar Roman), though the last four lives are single. All are invaluable sources of our knowledge of the lives and characters of Greek and Roman statesmen, soldiers and orators.

(Library of America Loren Eiseley Edition)</h2><p>An eminent paleontologist with the soul and skill of a poet, Loren Eiseley (1907&#x2013;1977) was among the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest inheritors of the literary&nbsp;tradition of Henry David Thoreau, Charles Darwin, and John Muir, and a precursor to such later writers as Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Dawkins, and Carl Sagan. After decades of fieldwork and discovery as a &#x201c;bone-hunter&#x201d; and professor, Eiseley turned late in life to the personal essay, and beginning with the surprise million-copy seller <b>The Immense Journey</b> (1957) he produced an astonishing succession of books that won acclaim both as science and as art.&nbsp;Now for the first time, the Library of America presents his landmark essay collections in a definitive two-volume set.<br><br>This first volume begins with Eiseley&#x2019;s debut collection, which displays his far-reaching knowledge and boundless curiosity about the mysteries of the natural world. Here are vivid accounts of prehistoric ecosystems, the origins of consciousness, the search for &#x201c;living fossils&#x201d; at the bottom of the sea, and the complexities of our evolutionary inheritance. Here too are literary qualities and aspirations that led many to hail Eiseley as a &#x201c;modern Thoreau&#x201d;: his quest for the ultimate meanings and cosmological significance of natural phenomena, along with his immense expressive gifts.&nbsp;<br> <i><br><b>The Firmament of Time </b></i>(1960), a lyrical and meditative tour de force, looks back at the many ways in which the sciences have been shaped by the changing cultures in which they developed. Examining the role of metaphor in scientific thought, anticipations of scientific discoveries in the works of poets and novelists, and the &#x201c;unconscious conformity&#x201d; of scientific theory to prevailing orthodoxies, Eiseley argues provocatively for the ongoing relevance to scientific progress of dreams, the imagination, and the irrational.<br><br>In his wide-ranging collection <b><i>The Unexpected Universe </i></b>(1969), Eiseley turns to the theme of the voyage of discovery: accounts of the mythical and historic journeys of&nbsp;Odysseus, Captain Cook, and Darwin frame his own more modest wanderings in the environs of Philadelphia. Sometimes he travels no farther than the local dump: and yet, like Homer&#x2019;s hero or these great explorers, he continually finds a universe &#x201c;not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> As an added feature, this volume presents a selection of Eiseley&#x2019;s uncollected prose, including early autobiographical sketches, vivid and haunting entries from his private notebooks, and his 1957 lecture &#x201c;Neanderthal Man and the Dawn of Human Paleontology.&#x201d;<br><br> A companion volume presents <b><i>The Invisible Pyramid </i></b>(1970), <b><i>The Night Country </i></b>(1971), and the essays gathered after his death in <b><i>The Star Thrower </i></b>(1978).<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

These structures, while cool in the summer, are of very low strength, are maintenance intensive, are time consuming to build, and are largely in massive disrepair. Replacing these mud structures with the light weight roofs of latex concrete produces a permanent architecture significantly more safe and strong, of very low maintenance, and of remarkably low cost, as the roofs can be built by available unskilled labor. The time required for reconstruction is considerably shorter than the time required to replace the older heavy construction, and the self-help characteristic of this new form of construction leads to more rapid recovery from disaster. </p> <p> This how-to-do-it manual teaches people how to build these new roofs. </p> <br></p><p></p><h2>Big Words Small Stories: The Missing Donut</h2><p>Here's a collection of short stories with a twist. The five stories all feature the misadventures of a boy named Cris, who likes things all in a row, and his cat, Crat, who likes to mix things up. Running within each of these lighthearted stories is another story, this one about the Sprinkle Fairy, owner of a word factory in Sicily, where the best words in the world come from. The Sprinkle Fairy has a team of helpers, called the Sprinklers, who have slipped one of her big words (like, discombobulated) into each of the small stories. Luckily, the Sprinklers provide warnings right before the big words appear ( Big word coming! ) and include their pronunciations and meanings afterward. Then, a bonus story at the end A Small Play on Big Words uses all the big words together. <br><br>Judith Henderson has created an innovative approach to an early reader that involves children in simple, fun-to-read stories, while using a clever, playful device to enrich their vocabularies at the same time.

McBeth on every page. The tone and accessibility are pitch-perfect for emerging readers.

Johnston: A Civil War Biography (Norton Paperback)</h2><p><p><strong>"Riveting. . . . A thoughtful biography." &#x2015;<em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p> General Joseph E. Johnston was in command of Confederate forces at the South's first victory&#x2015;Manassas in July 1861&#x2015;and at its last&#x2015;Bentonville in April 1965. Many of his contemporaries considered him the greatest southern field commander of the war; others ranked him second only to Robert E. Lee.<br><br> But Johnston was an enigmatic man. His battlefield victories were never decisive. He failed to save Confederate forces under siege by Grant at Vicksburg, and he retreated into Georgia in the face of Sherman's march. His intense feud with Jefferson Davis ensured the collapse of the Confederacy's western campaign in 1864 and made Johnston the focus of a political schism within the government.<br><br> Now in this rousing narrative of Johnston's dramatic career, Craig L. Symonds gives us the first rounded portrait of the general as a public and private man.<br></p><p>13 1.5-hour cassettesCraig L.

Goethe called it &#34;the loveliest complete work on a small scale, handed down to us as an ethical treatise and an idyll.&#34; Another writes, &#34;No poet in the world has written a more beautiful short story.&#34; The book tells about very ordinary people facing very ordinary events. We meet Naomi, who underwent hardship in famine and bereavement but eventually won peace and security. We meet Ruth, a young foreign woman from Moab who attached herself to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and to Naomi&#39;s God. And we meet Boaz, who by marrying Ruth fitted into God&#39;s purpose&#39;s for history. Both King David and Jesus are numbered among their descendants. Theologically the story of Ruth is a story about God&#39;s providence.

This relationship gave him an incomparable vantage point for writing a personalized, detailed biography of the great man.<br>In 1840 Schindler published the first, hastily written version of the biography, which was translated into English the following year by Ignaz Moscheles, the eminent pianist and Beethoven disciple. It was not until 1860, however, that Schindler published a carefully written, thoroughly revised edition, containing a great deal of new material. It is this third edition that is reprinted here in an English translation by Constance S. Jolly.<br>Extensively annotated by Beethoven scholar Donald W. MacArdle, this edition of the biography offers not only Schindler's intimate view of the composer &#x2014; his music, how he was viewed by his contemporaries, his personality, deafness and irascible behavior, and other aspects of his daily life &#x2014; but incorporates 100 years of subsequent Beethoven research.

Examining a multiracial suburb that is decidedly nonwhite, Wendy Cheng unpacks questions of how identity&#x2014;especially racial identity&#x2014;is shaped by place. She offers an in-depth portrait, enriched by nearly seventy interviews, of the San Gabriel Valley, not far from downtown Los Angeles, where approximately 60 percent of residents are Asian American and more than 30 percent are Latino. At first glance, the cities of the San Gabriel Valley look like stereotypical suburbs, but almost no one who lives there is white. </p><p><i>The Changs Next Door to the D�azes</i> reveals how a distinct culture is being fashioned in, and simultaneously reshaping, an environment of strip malls, multifamily housing, and faux Mediterranean tract homes. Informed by her interviews as well as extensive analysis of three episodic case studies, Cheng argues that people&#x2019;s daily experiences&#x2014;in neighborhoods, schools, civic organizations, and public space&#x2014;deeply influence their racial consciousness. In the San Gabriel Valley, racial ideologies are being reformulated by these encounters. Cheng views everyday landscapes as crucial terrains through which racial hierarchies are learned, instantiated, and transformed. She terms the process &#x201c;regional racial formation,&#x201d; through which locally accepted racial orders and hierarchies complicate and often challenge prevailing notions of race.</p><p>There is a place-specific state of mind here, Cheng finds. Understanding the processes of racial formation in the San Gabriel Valley in the contemporary moment is important in itself but also has larger value as a model for considering the spatial dimensions of racial formation and the significant demographic shifts taking place across the national landscape.<br></p></p><p><p>Wendy Cheng is assistant professor of Asian Pacific American studies and justice and social inquiry in the School of Social Transformation at Arizona State University.

This final volume presents new insights into and understanding of the General Epistles, James through Jude, and the book of the Revelation. It brings a greater clarity to the use of Semitic idiomatic expressions, admonitions, and teachings that the writers of the epistles wrote to the churches and scattered early Jewish believers in Jesus of Nazareth. It also decodes the Near Eastern, Semitic symbolism employed by the book of the Revelation. The method and style of writing is simple, informative, and scholarly, without using specialized theological terminology. Dr. Errico and Dr. Lamsa act as guides, revealing to Western readers a more intimate picture of the socio-religious and psychological environment of the times. They unlock many misunderstood passages and teachings that the authors of the general epistles used when writing their letters. They also open and clarify the mysterious and puzzling symbols of the Revelation, showing what these symbols meant for the people of that era., such as: The Seven Golden Lampstands, The Seven Spirits of God, The Name and Mark of the Beast, The New Jerusalem, The Return of the Tree of Life with its Healing leaves, The River of Life, and much more. Learn the simple truth of the Revelation. This volume is not just a revision of Dr. Lamsa s commentaries, New Testament Commentary, 1945, and More Light on the Gospel, 1968. Dr. Errico has edited, expanded and annotated these previous works in the new format that Dr. Lamsa desired. In addition, this book contains unpublished information that the two of them outlined prior to Dr. Lamsa s death in 1975. Dr. Errico completed these comments and has added more knowledge derived from his continual research in Near Eastern Semitic studies.</p><p>DR. ROCCO A.

(Anne Lamott)</b></p><p>In 2011, when she was in her late fifties, beloved author and journalist Joyce Maynard met the first true partner she had ever known. Jim wore a rakish hat over a good head of hair; he asked real questions and gave real answers; he loved to see Joyce shine, both in and out of the spotlight; and he didn&#x2019;t mind the mess she made in the kitchen. He was not the husband Joyce imagined, but he quickly became the partner she had always dreamed of.</p><p>Before they met, both had believed they were done with marriage, and even after they married, Joyce resolved that no one could alter her course of determined independence. Then, just after their one-year wedding anniversary, her new husband was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. During the nineteen months that followed, as they battled his illness together, she discovered for the first time what it really meant to be a couple--to be a true partner and to have one.</p><p>This is their story. Charting the course through their whirlwind romance, a marriage cut short by tragedy, and Joyce&#x2019;s return to singleness on new terms, <i>The Best of Us </i>is a heart-wrenching, ultimately life-affirming reflection on coming to understand true love through the experience of great loss.</p></p><p><b>Joyce Maynard</b> is the author of sixteen books including the novels <i>To Die For</i> and <i>Labor Day</i> (both adapted for film) and the bestselling memoir <i>At Home in the World</i>. Her essays and columns have appeared in dozens of publications and numerous collections. She is a frequent performer with The Moth, a fellow of the MacDowell Colony and Yaddo, and founder of the Lake Atitlan Writers' Workshop.

Perhaps with 'The Best of Us,' 'Maynard' will come to have new definitions: Maynard (verb) 1. To find love later in life. 2. To do anything possible to help a loved one in crisis. 3. To let oneself be changed by love. 4. To write movingly about it all.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>&#x201c;This haunting story, penned by a master wordsmith, is a reminder to savor every loved one and every day.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this touching memoir, Maynard (<i>To Die For; At Home in the World</i>) chronicles her second marriage. She beautifully renders the joy of falling in love later in life and the pain of watching her husband die of pancreatic cancer. Maynard's heartfelt story will resonate with those who have lost loved ones.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Joyce Maynard has been through so many ups and downs in her life and she communicates her love, pain and everything in between through her life affirming experiences, written with great emotion and clarity in this beautiful memoir.

Pinchas Lapide is a rabbi and theologian who has specialized in the study of the New Testament. In this book he convincingly shows that an irreducible minimum of experience underlies the New Testament account of the resurrection, however much of the details of the narrative may be open to objection. He maintains that life after death is part of the Jewish faith experience, and that it is Jesus&#39; messiahship, not his resurrection, which marks the division between Christianity and Judaism. Dr. Lapide quotes Moses Maimonides, the greatest Jewish thinker, in his support: All these matters which refer to Jesus of Nazareth...only served to make the way free for the King Messiah and to prepare the whole world for the worship of God with a united heart.&#34;</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>American Loyalist Troops 1775&#x2013;84 (Men-at-Arms, 450)</h2><p><p>To mark the 450th book in the Men-at-Arms series we return to the subject of the very first book in the series, which was published nearly 35 years ago.

After the final British defeat the survivors and their families withdrew, many into Canada, where they continued to provide a loyal militia to defend the Crown territory. This book will provide updated and comprehensive information on unit identities, commanders, strengths, areas of enlistment, combat record, tactics, uniforms and equipment.</p></p><p>Ren_ Chartrand was born in Montreal and educated in Canada, the United States and the Bahamas.

Most dwarves are born deep underground, at least a mile below The Surface, preferably in a cavern filled with crystals and gems: diamonds for strength, emeralds for wisdom, and sapphires for truth.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mothers and fathers try to feed their dwarflings as many healthy powerful gems as they can within a few hours of birth, to give them the best chance in life. But I was fed none.<br> &nbsp;<br> My parents had been traveling downward the day I was born. Mother could feel me turning hard inside her belly, a sign that the time was drawing near. She wanted the very best for me. She wanted to be as deep in the earth as possible, in the birthing caverns, with their rich deposits of nutritious crystals and gems. But as my parents traveled downward, before they had even descended below the main cavern, there was a sudden collapse in one of the tunnels. The rocks nearly crushed my mother, and me with her. My father was able to get us out of the way just in time.<br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, the collapse had blocked the tunnel, so we had to go up to find another way down. The strain of the climb was too much for my poor mother.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rubald!&#x201d; she cried, clutching her belly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And there was no time to waste. A dwarfling can stay inside its mother&#x2019;s belly for a solid decade or more, but when we&#x2019;re ready to come out, we come fast.<br> &nbsp;<br> And so I was born in a cavern mere feet below the earth&#x2019;s surface, where roots dangled from the ceiling, water trickled down the walls, and the only available food was a salty gruel called strolg, made out of common rocks and minerals. Mother was devastated.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My poor little dwarfling!&#x201d; she cooed as she spooned the strolg into my mouth, then fed me a few pebbles to satisfy my need to bite and crunch. &#x201c;What kind of life will he have, Rubald?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A fine life, Rumelda,&#x201d; said my father, ever the optimist. &#x201c;A happy life.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And what will we call him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My parents both looked at their surroundings. Dwarves are usually named with some regard to the gems and crystals within the cavern in which they are born, but there were no diamonds or sapphires in that cavern. Not even quartz or marble. Just plain rocks and roots.<br> &nbsp;<br> Father brushed his hands over the rough walls, studying the layers of dirt and minerals. &#x201c;Borlen,&#x201d; he said with wonder.<br> &nbsp;<br> Borlen was a mineral found only near The Surface. It was not so common in our colony but useful when it could be found. It was too bitter to eat, but potters liked it because it made their clay more malleable without weakening it. Borlen could also serve as a warning. A mining crew knew by the sight of it that they were digging dangerously close to The Surface. Most dwarves would rather not find any.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll call him Borlen,&#x201d; said Father.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think that name will make him seem a bit . . . odd?&#x201d; Mother asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s special,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be one of a kind, our dwarfling. We&#x2019;ll get him deep into the earth as soon as possible and feed him all the best crystals and gems. But wait!&#x201d; My father pulled something from his pocket and held it out to my mother. &#x201c;I almost forgot. I&#x2019;ve been saving this from the moment I knew we had a dwarfling on the way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mother gasped. &#x201c;A ruby!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rubies were rare and particularly powerful gems. They could ward off evil, enhance powers, and even lengthen lives. Emegert of Tunnel 588 was said to have found a large deposit of rubies, and he lived for ten thousand years. Two thousand years was considered a good long life for a dwarf.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mother took the ruby from my father and dropped it onto my tongue. I crunched on the gem, gave a little belch, and fell asleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> The very next day, my parents tried to move me to deeper caverns, but as soon as they started to carry me downward, I began to cry. The deeper we went, the louder I wailed, until my eyes leaked tears of dust, a sign of deep distress and discomfort from any dwarf.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh dear,&#x201d; said Mother. &#x201c;Rubald, I think our dwarfling is afraid of depths!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nonsense,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;He only needs to adjust.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But I did not adjust. I cried for hours on end. My parents tried everything to console me. They fed me amber, amethyst, and blue-laced agate. They bathed me in crushed rose quartz and hung peridot above my cradle, all to no avail. And so, distraught from my endless wails, and desperate to try anything, my parents took me back to the cavern near The Surface where I was born.<br> &nbsp;<br> I stopped crying.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh dear,&#x201d; said Mother.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How odd,&#x201d; said Father.<br> &nbsp;<br> And after that, my parents were obliged to make my unfortunate birthing cavern our home, hoping my fear of depths would subside eventually. But it didn&#x2019;t. It only got worse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> For years, my parents worked to get me used to depths. Father tried to lead me a little deeper each day, luring me with my favorite gems and the different sights and wonders of the colony--the lava rivers, the blue springs, the dragon hatchery, the potters and glassblowers and goldsmiths. But no matter how interesting the surroundings, no matter how many sapphires and rubies he offered, my depth symptoms would always overpower me. I&#x2019;d start to get dizzy, then I&#x2019;d feel like I was shrinking and shriveling, and we&#x2019;d have to go back home.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was shameful enough that I was afraid of depths, but that wasn&#x2019;t the worst of it. As much as I hated going downward, I was equally drawn to going upward. My first word was &#x201c;up,&#x201d; much to my parents&#x2019; chagrin, and as soon as I understood that there was an actual world above us, I wanted to know everything about it. I pestered my parents with questions. What did The Surface look like? How was it different from our caves? Did any dwarves live up there? Why didn&#x2019;t we live up there? Could we go there?<br> &nbsp;<br> My parents knew next to nothing about The Surface. Neither of them had seen it, nor did they have any desire to. Mother usually sidestepped my questions or changed the subject, but Father indulged my curiosity. He took me to the colony&#x2019;s records room--a vast cavern filled with many millennia of our history and collective knowledge engraved on stone tablets and slates. Normally, I wouldn&#x2019;t have tolerated the depths of the cavern, but my thirst for information overcame my fear. I scoured the records for any facts I could find about The Surface. I learned it was a big, open place with an endless blue ceiling called the sky, and a big golden ball suspended in the sky called the sun. There were things that grew on The Surface that didn&#x2019;t grow underground. Things called trees and flowers and bushes. There were strange beasts that roamed The Surface--horses, bears, and wolves.

Many of the 80 million homes in the United States<br>today have only loose-fitting, general names like ranch, duplex, bungalow, and flat.<br>Most, however, cannot even be identified by these common names, much less by an<br>architectural type such as Colonial, Italianate, or Queen Anne. The few regionally<br>recognized vernacular terms&#x2014; shotgun, Cape (Cod), three-decker, and the like&#x2014;remain<br>exceptions rather than the rule. In this innovative, copiously illustrated guide, Thomas C.<br>Hubka considers why most ordinary, working-class houses lack an adequate identifying<br>nomenclature and proposes new ways to name and classify these anonymous structures,<br>shedding a fresh light on their role in the development of American domestic culture and<br>its housing landscape.<br><br>Popular, developer-built, tract, speculative, everyday&#x2014;whatever they are called,<br>these common homes constitute the largest portion of American housing in all regions<br>and historic periods. Without classification, these dwellings tend to be left out of histories<br>of American building, neglected in preservation surveys and plans, and ignored when it<br>comes to considering their impact on American culture. Current methods of interpreting<br>common houses need not be replaced, Hubka shows, but only modified to include a<br>broader, more complete spectrum of common dwellings. As Hubka explains, by applying<br>an order of census and a floor-plan analysis, scholars can adequately characterize<br>the actual homes in which most Americans live, particularly in recent times after the<br>widespread growth of suburban homes.<br><br>Based on years of field observations, measured drawings, and surveys of regional<br>house types, this handbook provides a working vocabulary for the study and appreciation<br>of America�s common houses and will prove useful to preservationists, academics, and<br>architects, as well as owners and residents of America�s most ubiquitous residences.<br></p><p><br>Thomas C.

An expert in modern Indonesian history, genocide, and human rights, Geoffrey Robinson sets out to account for this violence and to end the troubling silence surrounding it. In doing so, he sheds new light on broad, enduring historical questions. How do we account for instances of systematic mass killing and detention? Why are some of these crimes remembered and punished, while others are forgotten? Based on a rich body of primary and secondary sources, <i>The Killing Season</i> is the definitive account of a pivotal period in Indonesian history.</p></p><p><p>"Finally, a full accounting of one of the most brutal events in twentieth-century history. Geoffrey Robinson's <i>The Killing Season</i> documents, in chilling detail, the mass murder of half a million Indonesians between 1965 and 1966. Based on fine-grained research, Robinson's book is a model of analytical and moral clarity, shining a damning light on U.S. complicity in the atrocity. This is a tour de force."<b>--Greg Grandin, author of <i>Fordlandia</i></b></p><p>"This elegantly written and carefully crafted book provides the single most sustained and systematic evaluation of the competing and contradictory theories concerning the coup which helped to precipitate the mass killings of late 1965 and early 1966 in Indonesia. Robinson's arguments are clear, coherent, and compelling, and the evidence presented is impressively well-documented. This is the definitive account of a highly important aspect of Indonesian history."<b>--John T. Sidel, London School of Economics and Political Science</b></p><p>"This masterful and engrossing book illuminates the mass violence and incarceration that took place during the transition to the three-decade Suharto dictatorship in Indonesia. Displaying a superb command of Indonesian history and sources, <i> The Killing Season</i> is an important corrective to conventional wisdom about a little-known genocidal campaign that destroyed an estimated 500,000 victims."<b>--Jens Meierhenrich, London School of Economics and Political Science</b></p><b>Geoffrey B.

The second part of the book consists of philosophical reflections on the first and proposes the practice of imagination as a way of evolutionary development. Many traditions have spoken of a &#34;higher consciousness,&#34; but Schwaller de Lubicz&#39;s attempt to formulate in modern terms an alchemical science of qualities, functions, analogies and signatures is unique.</p><p>R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz (1887-1961) was one of the most important philosophers, mathematicians, and Egyptologists of this century. His elucidation of the temple at Luxor and his presentation of the Egyptian understanding of a special quality of innate consciousness form a bridge that links the sacred science of the Ancients to its rediscovery in our own time.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Mystery of Christian Worship (Milestones in Catholic Theology)</h2><p>A Benedictine monk at Maria Laach, Odo Casel was a major force in the movement for renewal of liturgy in this century. He objected to rationalistic or anthropocentric interpretations of the Christian religion that would reduce it either to a collection of doctrines or to a moral code. Instead, he insisted that the core of Christian faith is the worship of a sacred mystery. For Casel, liturgy means &#34;the making real of the mystery of Christ in the new alliance throughout the whole church, in all centuries; in it her healing and glory are made fact.&#34; This essay presents the heart of Casel&#39;s theology of mystery, summing up his view that the encounter with the divine Mystery in liturgy is &#34;the most central and most essential action of the Christian religion.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>YumUniverse: Infinite Possibilities for a Gluten-Free, Plant-Powerful, Whole-Food Lifestyle</h2><p><b>More than 150 plant-based, gluten-free, soy-free recipes!</b> <br> <br>No matter where you land on the diet spectrum, more whole, plant-based foods can enrich your life and improve your health.<br> <br>If you&#x2019;re transitioning to a plant-based diet or you just want some ideas for preparing scrumptious veggie dishes, Heather Crosby provides a step-by-step guide to simply adding more delicious, health-boosting meals to your existing routine, whether you&#x2019;re a meat-eater or a vegan.<br> <br> <i>YumUniverse: Infinite Possibilities for a Gluten-Free, Plant-Powerful, Whole-Food Lifestyle</i> offers a creative collection of more than 150 craveable recipes without meat, dairy, gluten, or soy.

In 1971 he published his first novel, a collaboration with Jean-Pierre Bastid, and went on to produce ten subsequent works over the course of the next two decades and establishing a new genre of French novel, the n�o-polar (distinguished from traditional detective novel, or polar, by its political engagement and social radicalism).

Engaging with sculpture, conceptual artwork, and painting by emerging and established artists, De Boever proposes a worldly, democratic notion of unexceptional art as an antidote to the problems of aesthetic exceptionalism.<br><br><i>Forerunners: Ideas First<br> Short books of thought-in-process scholarship, where intense analysis, questioning, and speculation take the lead</i></p></p><p><p>Arne De Boever is faculty in the School of Critical Studies and director of the MA Aesthetics and Politics program at the California Institute of the Arts.

However, jealousy is one of the primary attributes of the great leaders in the Bible. </p> <br><br><p> As human jealousy is seldom uncontaminated with sin, it tends only to be understood as a negative emotion. However, the Bible tells us that God is a jealous God, and Erik Thoennes offers us unique insights into Godly Jealousy as taught in Scipture, and also looks closely at biblical leaders who displayed Godly human jealousy. Thoennes masterfully draws ethical and theological implications from godly jealousy for the 21st Century. </p><br><p> This book is a must read for anyone who is concerned with character development and who seeks to know the central values needed in the church today.</p></p><p>Professor of Theology, Chair, Undergraduate Theology, Biola University/Talbot School of Theology and Pastor, Grace Evangelical Free Church, La Mirada California. <br>"Here is biblical exegesis at its best. While realistic in application to the world, Dr. Thoennes lifts the reader heavenward, and leaves one with a deeper sense of the greatness of God." (Robert E. Coleman, Gordon-Conwell Theology Seminary, Boston, Massachusetts)<br><br>"Carefully researched and clearly written, this book shows that there is a good kind of godly jealousy which will give backbone and courage to our Christian lives." (Wayne Grudem ~ Research Professor of Theology and Biblical Studies, Phoenix Seminary, Phoenix, Arizona)<br><br>"In this scholarly yet accessible book, Professor Thoennes fills a huge void regarding godly jealousy."

But I would argue that all I am doing is responding to a natural need we all have. Humans have always been migrants, the physiological urge to be nomadic is deep-rooted in all of us and perhaps because of that our brains are stimulated by walking. I solve all sorts of problems, formulate ideas, work things out to that gentle rhythm of self-propelled movement.</i>' - <b>Kate Humble</b><br><i>Thinking on My Feet</i> tells the story of Kate's walking year - shining a light on the benefits of this simple activity. Kate's inspiring narrative not only records her walks (and runs) throughout a single year, but also charts her feelings and impressions throughout - capturing the perspectives that only a journey on foot allows - and shares the outcomes: a problem solved, a mood lifted, an idea or opportunity borne. As she explores the reasons why we walk, whether for creative energy, challenge and pleasure, or therapeutic benefits, Kate's reflections and insights will encourage, motivate and spur readers into action.<br>Also featured are Kate's walks with others who have discovered the magical, soothing effect of putting one foot in front of the other - the artist who walks to find inspiration for his next painting; the man who takes people battling with addiction to climb mountains; the woman who walked every footpath in Wales (3,700 miles) when she discovered she had cancer.<br>This book will inspire you to change your perspective by applying walking to your daily endeavours.</p><p>Kate Humble is a farmer, writer, activist, entrepreneur and one of the UK's best-known TV presenters. She started her television career as a researcher, later presenting programmes such as 'Animal Park', 'Springwatch &amp; Autumnwatch', 'Lambing Live', 'Living with Nomads', 'Extreme Wives' and 'Back to the Land'.

Hundreds of environmental and weather modifying technologies have been patented in the United States alone-and hundreds more are being developed in civilian, academic, military and quasi-military laboratories around the world at this moment! This book lays bare the grim facts of who is doing it and why. The earth and the sky have themselves been turned into weapons! Underground nuclear tests in Nevada have set off earthquakes. A Russian company has been offering to sell typhoons on demand since the 1990s. Scientists have been searching for ways to move hurricanes for over 50 years-the same timeframe that took us from the Wright Brothers to Neil Armstrong. In this book, Jerry E. Smith picks up where his 1998 book about the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) left off. He reports on recent developments at HAARP, including its possible connection to the crash of the Space Shuttle Columbia and what role, if any, it played in certain &#x201c;natural" disasters, like Hurricane Katrina. Tackling the chemtrail controversy, Smith examines claims that particles called aerosols are being deliberately injected into the atmosphere. Edward Teller, father of the hydrogen bomb, proposed putting up a &#x201c;sun screen" of aerosols to save the earth from global warming-is someone actually doing it? Numerous ongoing military programs do inject aerosols at high altitude for communications and surveillance operations. Could these include mind control or population control applications? Smith puts these technologies into context by examining the geopolitical conflicts that are driving their development from Globalization to the rise of Neo-Con Neo-Fascism.</p><p>Jerry E. Smith has been a writer, editor and activist for over three decades. His bibliography includes scores of non-fiction articles and reviews, and more than a dozen ghost-written books.</p><h2>The Secret of the Incas: Myth, Astronomy, and the War Against Time</h2><p>Step by step, Sullivan pieces together the hidden esoteric tradition of the Andes to uncover the tragic secret of the Incas, a tribe who believed that, if events in the heavens could influence those on earth, perhaps the reverse could be true. Anyone who reads this book will never look at the ruins of the Incas, or at the night sky, the same way again. Illustrations.</p><p><b>William Sullivan</b> holds a BA from Harvard College and a doctorate from the Centre of Amerindian, Latin American and Caribbean Studies at the University of St. Andrews. He lives in Massachusetts.A sometimes murky, frequently meandering excursion into the meaning of ancient Andean beliefs, arguing that in a series of sophisticated myths Incan soothsayers foretold their own civilization's doom at the hands of Pizarro and his conquistadors in 1532. Sullivan, a scholar of Native American cultures, begins with a question that has perplexed historians of the Spanish conquest: How could the vast Inca Empire, with its millions of subjects, have been conquered overnight by a band of 170 Spanish adventurers? Sullivan digs into the history and mythology of Andean civilization to find what he feels is the answer: For hundreds of years the sages of the Andes had believed that astronomical transitions presaged earthly cataclysms; reading changes in the night skies in the 1400s, Incan priest-astronomers foretold the imminent destruction of their own recently founded empire. Sullivan argues, in a sometimes hyperbolic first-person account (``In that moment I had, I believed, touched for an instant the terrible burden and tragic urgency of the Inca vision''), that the Incas followed the planets, recorded precessional events in their myths, and equated social and celestial changes. He further asserts that elements in Incan culture preceding Pizarro's arrival--constant warfare and the Incan ritual of human sacrifice--represented an attempt to halt the march of time and prevent the apocalyptic events foreshadowed by changes in the night sky. The Incas assumed that the arrival of Pizarro represented the culmination of the prophecy and the failure of their own efforts to prevent its occurrence. The thread of the author's argument can be hard to follow. Still, Sullivan's deep feeling for Andean folk materials, and the originality of his observations about Andean astronomy, make his text worthwhile for those interested in the history of South American civilization and for those who, in the wake of Joseph Campbell's works, seek enduring meaning in ancient mythology.

The concept was born as a result of General Curtis LeMay&#x2019;s desire for a heavy bomber with the weapon load and range of the subsonic B-52 and a top speed in excess of the supersonic medium bomber, the B-58 Hustler. If LeMay&#x2019;s plans came to fruition there would be 250 Valkyries in the air; it would be the pinnacle of his quest for the ultimate strategic bomber operated by America&#x2019;s Strategic Air Command. The design was a leap into the future that pushed the envelope in terms of exotic materials, avionics and power plants. <br><br>However, in April 1961, Defense Secretary McNamara stopped the production go-ahead for the B-70 on grounds of rapid cost escalation and the USSR&#x2019;s newfound ability of destroying aircraft at extremely high altitude by either missiles or the new Mig-25 fighter. Nevertheless, in 1963 plans for the production of three high-speed research aircraft were approved and construction proceeded. In September 1964 the first Valkyrie, now re-coded A/V-1 took to the air for the first time and in October went supersonic.<br><br>This book is the most detailed description of the design, engineering and research that went into this astounding aircraft. It is full of unpublished details, photographs and firsthand accounts from those closely associated with the project. Although never put into full production, this giant six engined aircraft became famous for its breakthrough technology, and the spectacular images captured on a fatal air-to-air photo shoot when an observing Starfighter collided with Valkyrie A/V-2 which crashed into the Mojave Desert.<br><br>The loss of the $750 million aircraft and two lives stopped future development, although there were several attempts to redesign it as an airliner to compete against the European Concorde.</p><p>English professional aviation writer, publisher and historian Graham M Simons is one of the founders of the world famous aviation museum at Duxford near Cambridge where his interest was piqued watching the making of the &#x2018;Battle of Britain&#x2019; film there in the late 1960&#x2019;s and from the days when you could go &#x2018;aircraft spotting&#x2019; at London Heathrow and other airports.</p><h2>Practical Herbs 1 (Practical Herbs series)</h2><p><i>Practical Herbs</i> is written for everyone who likes to harvest and process their own herbs from the wild or from their gardens.

But as Native people become mobile, reservation lands become overcrowded and the state seeks to enforce means of containment, closing its borders to incoming, often indigenous, immigrants.</p><br><p>In <i>Mark My Words</i>, Mishuana Goeman traces settler colonialism as an enduring form of gendered spatial violence, demonstrating how it persists in the contemporary context of neoliberal globalization. The book argues that it is vital to refocus the efforts of Native nations beyond replicating settler models of territory, jurisdiction, and race. Through an examination of twentieth-century Native women&#x2019;s poetry and prose, Goeman illuminates how these works can serve to remap settler geographies and center Native knowledges. She positions Native women as pivotal to how our nations, both tribal and nontribal, have been imagined and mapped, and how these women play an ongoing role in decolonization.</p><br><p>In a strong and lucid voice, Goeman provides close readings of literary texts, including those of E.

These two opposing fighters were the products of two radically different design philosophies. The Thunderbolt was heavy, fast, and packed a massive punch thanks to its battery of eight 0.50-cal machine guns, while the &#x201c;Oscar&#x201d; was the complete opposite in respect to fighter design philosophy--lightweight, nimble, maneuverable, and lightly armed. It was, nonetheless, deadly in the hands of an experienced pilot.

Flying from there, they would pick off unwary enemy aircraft during dedicated fighter patrols. The Thunderbolt pilots in New Guinea slowly wore down their Japanese counterparts by continual combat and deadly strafing attacks, but nevertheless, the Ki-43-II remained a worthy opponent deterrent up until Hollandia was abandoned by the IJAAF in April 1944.</p><p>Fully illustrated throughout with artwork and rare photographs, this fascinating book examines these two vastly different fighters in the New Guinea theater, and assesses the unique geographic conditions that shaped their deployment and effectiveness.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael John Claringbould</b> was raised in Papua New Guinea, where he became fascinated by the Pacific air war.

The other bushes had not been affected-they flourished around her, glistening with a sprinkling of dewdrops. A bed of Darwin tulip hybrids blossomed bright red and yellow along her greenhouse's glass shell. Behind her, against the solid wall of her house, a flat of purple orchids filled the air with their sweet aroma. A dozen other species of roses grew in neat boxes, none of them infected.</p> <p>But this bush had lost its leaves and shriveled in the space of five days, and that was a problem because this wasn't just another rosebush. This was Nadia's rosebush. </p> <p>Ivena delicately pried through the dried thorny stems, searching for signs of disease or insects. She'd already tried a host of remedies, from pesticides to a variety of growth agents, all to no avail. It was a Serbian Red from the saxifrage family, snipped from the bush that she and Sister Flouta had planted by the cross. </p> <p>When Ivena had left Bosnia for Atlanta, she'd insisted on a greenhouse; it was the one unbreakable link to her past. She made a fine little business selling the flowers to local floral shops in Atlanta, but the real purpose for the greenhouse was this one rosebush, wasn't it? Yes, she knew that as surely as she knew that blood flowed in her veins.</p> <p>And now Nadia's rose was dying. Or dead.</p> <p>Ivena put one hand on her hip and ran the other through her gray curls. She'd cared for a hundred species of roses over her sixty years and never, never had she seen such a thing. Each bud from Nadia's bush was priceless. If there was a graftable branch alive she would snip it off and nurse it back to health. But every branch seemed affected.</p> <p>"Oh, dear Nadia, what am I going to do? What am I going to do?"</p> <p>She couldn't answer herself for the simple reason that she had no clue what she would do. She had never considered the possibility that this, the crown of her flower garden, might one day die for no apparent reason at all. It was a travesty.</p> <p>Ivena picked through the branches again, hoping that she was wrong. Dried dirt grayed her fingers. They weren't as young or as smooth as they once had been, but years of working delicately around thorns had kept them nimble. Graceful. She could walk her way through a rosebush blindfolded without so much as touching a thorn. But today she felt clumsy and old.</p> <p>The stalk between her fingers suddenly snapped. Ivena blinked. It was as dry as tinder. How could it fail so fast? She tsked and shook her head. But then something caught her eye and she stopped.</p> <p>Immediately beneath the branch that had broken, a very small shoot of green angled from the main stalk. That was odd. She lowered her head for a closer look. </p> <p>The shoot grew out a mere centimeter, almost like a stalk of grass. She touched it gently, afraid to break it. And as she did she saw the tiny split in the bark along the base of that shoot.</p> <p>She caught her breath. Strange! It looked like a small graft! </p> <p>But she hadn't grafted anything into the plant, had she? No, of course not. She remembered every step of care she'd given this plant over the last five years and none of them included a graft. </p> <p>It looked like someone had slit the base of the rosebush open and grafted in this green shoot. And it didn't look like a rose graft either. The stalk was a lighter green. So then maybe it wasn't a graft. Maybe it was a parasite of some kind. </p> <p>Ivena let her breath out slowly and touched it again. It was already healed at the insertion point. </p> <p>"Hmmm."</p> <p>She straightened and walked to the round table where a white porcelain cup still steamed with tea. She lifted it to her lips. The rich aroma of spice warmed her nostrils and she paused, staring through the wisps of steam.</p> <p>From this distance of ten feet Nadia's rosebush looked like the Moses' burning bush, but consumed by the flame and burned black. Dead branches reached up from the soil like claws from a grave. Dead. </p> <p>Except for that one tiny shoot of green at its base. </p> <p>It was very strange indeed.</p> <p>Ivena lowered herself into the old wood-spindle chair beside the table, still looking over the teacup to the rosebush. She sat here every morning, humming and sipping her tea and whispering her words to the Father. But today the sight before her was turning things on their heads.</p> <p>She lowered the cup without drinking. "Father, what are you doing here?" she said softly.</p> <p>Not that he was necessarily doing anything. Rosebushes died, after all. Perhaps with less encouragement than other plants. But an air of consequence had settled on Ivena, and she couldn't ignore it. </p> <p>Across the beds of flourishing flowers before her sat this one dead bush-an ugly black scar on a landscape of bright color. But then from the blackened stalk that impossible graft.</p> <p>"What are you saying here, Father?"</p> <p>She did not hear his answer, but that didn't mean he wasn't talking. He could be yelling for all she knew. Here on Earth it might come through as a distant whisper, easily mistaken for the sound of a gentle breeze. Actually the greenhouse was dead silent. She more felt something, and it could just as easily have been a draft that tickled her hair, or a finger of emotion from the past, as the voice of God.</p> <p>Still the scene before her began to massage her heart with fingers of meaning. She just didn't know what that meaning was yet.</p> <p>Ivena hummed and a blanket of peace settled over her. She whispered, "Lover of my soul, I worship you. I kiss your feet. Don't ever let me forget." Her words echoed softly through the quiet greenhouse, and she smiled. The Creator was a mischievous one, she often thought. At least playful and easily delighted. And he was up to something, wasn't he?</p> <p>A splash of red at her elbow caught her eye. It was her copy of the book. The Dance of the Dead. Its surreal cover showed a man's face wide open with laughter, tears leaking down his cheek.</p> <p>Still smiling, Ivena set down her teacup and lifted the book from the table. She ran a hand over the tattered cover. She'd read it a hundred times, of course. But it never lost its edge. Its pages oozed with love and laughter and the heart of the Creator.</p> <p>She opened the book and brushed through a few dozen dog-eared pages. He had written a masterpiece, and in some ways it was as much God's words as his. She could begin in the middle or at the beginning or the end and it wouldn't hardly matter. The meaning would not be lost. She opened to the middle and read a few sentences.</p> <p>It was odd how such a story could bring this warmth to her heart. But it did, it really did, and that was because her eyes had been opened a little as well. She'd seen a few things through God's eyes.</p> <p>Ivena glanced up at the dying rosebush with its impossible graft. Something new was beginning today. But everything had really started with the story in her hands, hadn't it? </p> <p>A small spark of delight ran through her bones. She smoothed her dress, crossed her legs and lowered her eyes to the page. </p> <p>Yes, this was how it all started.</p> <p>Twenty years ago in Bosnia. At the end of the war with the Nazis.</p> <p>She read.</p> <p>_</p> <p>Father Micheal saw the soldiers when they entered the cemetery at the edge of the village. Their small shapes emerged out of the green meadow, like a row of scarecrows tattered by the war. He pulled up and a chill swept down his spine. For a moment the children's laughter about him waned.</p> <p>Dear God, protect us. He prayed the words as he had prayed them a hundred times before, but he couldn't stop the tremble that took to his fingers. </p> <p>They were a haggard lot. Then again, any soldier who'd managed to survive the brutal fighting that had ravaged Yugoslavia in its liberation from the Nazis would look no different. It was commonplace. But their presence here, in this secluded valley hidden from the war, was not commonplace.</p> <p>The smell of hot baked bread wafted through his nostrils. A shrill giggle echoed through the courtyard; water gurgled from the natural spring to his left. Father Micheal stood stooped atop the stone-hewn steps that led to the tall church behind him, and looked past the courtyard in which the children and women laughed in celebration of Nadia's birthday, past the tall stone cross that marked the entrance to the graveyard, past the red rosebushes Claudis Flouta had so carefully planted about her home, to the lush hillside on the south.</p> <p>To the four-no five-to the five soldiers approaching.</p> <p>He glanced around the courtyard-they laughed and played, enjoying the cele-bration. None of the others had seen the soldiers yet. High above ravens called and Micheal looked up to see four of them circling. He'd dreamed of ravens twice in the last week and each time he'd awoken shaken. But surely this was nothing more than a coincidence.</p> <p>Father, protect your children. A flutter of wings to his right caught his attention. He turned and watched a white dove settle for a landing on the vestibule's roof. It cocked its head and eyed him in small jerky movements.</p> <p>"Father Micheal?" a child's voice said. </p> <p>Micheal turned to face Nadia, who stood trying to hide a faint grin. She wore a pink dress reserved for special occasions. Her eyes sparked blue, like the sea, innocent above a wide nose and blotchy freckles. Her left leg was two inches shorter than her right compliments of polio-a bad case when she was only three. Perhaps their handicaps united them in ways the others could not understand. She with her short leg; he with his hunched back. </p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Petrus says that since I'm twelve now all the boys will want to marry me. I told him that he's being a foolish little boy, but he insists on running around making a silly game of it. Could you please tell him to stop?"</p> <p>Petrus ran up, sneering. If any of the town's forty-three children was a bully, it was this nine-year-old. Oh, he had his sweet side, no doubt. Micheal had repeatedly insisted so to the boy's mother who was known to run about the village with her apron flying, leaving wafts of flour in her wake, shaking her rolling pin while calling for the rascal to get his little rear end home. </p> <p>"Nadia loves Milus! Nadia loves Milus!" he chanted and skipped by, looking back, daring her to take up chase.</p> <p>"You're a misguided fledgling, Petrus," Nadia said, crossing her arms. "A silly little bird, squawking too much. Why don't you find your worms somewhere else?"</p> <p>Petrus pulled up, flushing red. "Oh, you with all your fancy words! You are the one eating worms. With Milus! Nadia and Milus sitting in a tree, eating all the worms they can see!" He sang the verse again and ran off with a whoop, obviously delighted with his victory.</p> <p>Nadia placed her hands on her hips and tapped her shorter leg with a disgusted sigh. "You see. He's also insisting this madness about Milus. Please stop him, Father."</p> <p>"Of course, darling. But you know that he is just playing." Father Micheal smiled. Nadia might never win a beauty contest, but she surely had the quickest wit of any child he knew. He suppressed the urge to sweep her off her feet and swing her around in his arms. "Come unto me as little children," the Master had said. If only the whole world were filled with the innocence of children. Or better yet, filled with the innocent tenacity of Nadia-among all of these children protected from the war's ravages in this hidden village, Nadia was the most pure. Blameless like a dove despite her uncanny perception of truth and dogged determination to defend that truth. If there was a such a thing as a spiritual prodigy, Nadia was one such person.</p> <p>_</p> <p>Ivena stopped her reading and looked up, chuckling. Nadia had always been such a smart one. Always would be. She picked up her cup of tea and sipped. And what smart words would Nadia have for the death of her rosebush?</p> <p>She set the cup down and continued.</p> <p>_</p> <p>Father Micheal looked over the courtyard. Of the village's seventy remaining souls, all but ten or so had come today for Nadia's birthday. Only the men were missing, called off to war. The elderly sat in groups about the stone tables, grinning and chatting as they watched the children play a party game that Ivena, Nadia's mother, conducted. Several of the mothers busied themselves over a long table on which they had arranged pastries and the cake Ivena had fretted over for two days. It was perhaps the grandest cake Micheal had ever seen, a foot high and white with pink roses made from frosting. </p> <p>Micheal's heart swelled. They were his children. All of them. God had given him these to care for as his own twenty years earlier and he had done so. It had been his first and only church. </p> <p>From the corner of his eyes he saw that the soldiers drew nearer and he cast them a glance. Micheal held his robe and sat on the steps. "Come here, Nadia." He lifted an arm for her to sit by him and she limped up the steps. A spark filled her blue eyes and he knew that thoughts of the boy's teasing had taken flight. Nadia sat beside him and he pulled her close. She laid her head on his shoulder and put a frail arm around his back, rubbing his humped back as if it were a perfectly natural feature.</p> <p>He swallowed a lump gathering in his throat and kissed the top of her head. "Don't mind Petrus, dear. I fear one day the men will line up to marry such a pretty woman as you will be."</p> <p>She showed her age now with a little giggle.</p> <p>The soldiers drew near through the graveyard not a hundred yards off. They were Partisans, he saw with some relief. Partisans were likely friendly.</p> <p>High above the ravens cawed. There were five now, black against the white sky. Micheal looked to his right, to the vestibule roof. The lone dove stared on and clucked with its one eye peeled to the courtyard. </p> <p>Father Micheal looked back to the soldiers. "Nadia, go tell your mother to come," he said.</p> <p>She followed his stare and saw them. The smile left her.</p> <p>_</p> <p>Janjic Jovic, the nineteen-year-old writer turned soldier, followed the others to the village, trudging with the same rhythmic cadence his marching had found in the endless months leading up to this day. Just one foot after another. Ahead and to the right of him their commander, Karadzic, marched deliberately. The other three were fanned out to his left. </p> <p>They had no business here, and Janjic had told Karadzic so at the top of the hill an hour earlier, when they'd first stumbled on this valley. Their mission was to join the main column twenty miles north, not go searching for churches to burn. The commander had nearly bitten Janjic's head off with his crude diatribe on the real purpose for this war. It had much less to do with Nazis and much more to do with restoring Serbia; the purging of her enemies-and that included anyone who wasn't a good Serb. Especially Franciscans.</p> <p>The whole thing was nonsense, of course. They all knew that Karadzic killed good Serbs as easily as Franciscans. His own mother, for example; with a knife, he'd bragged. For being both a Christian and a whore. Never mind that she was...</p></p><h2>Living With Less: An Unexpected Key to Happiness</h2><p>Since the day you were born, you've been told to pursue more.

After the debate about whether sea anemones made better pretend moustaches or better pretend eyebrows when you stuck them to your face, this was easily the pirates&#x2019; favourite topic of conversation. Discussions onboard a pirate boat usually escalated into violence without much prompting, and the albino pirate was just about to empty a carton of milk over the pirate with gout&#x2019;s head when the door crashed open and into the kitchen strode the Pirate Captain himself. <br><br>Even in slippers and dressing gown, the Pirate Captain cut an imposing figure. If you were to compare him to a type of font &#x2013; because whilst the pirates usually liked to compare people to types of tree, just recently they had taken to comparing people to other stuff as well, like fonts, or creatures, or makes of cheese &#x2013; he would undoubtedly be Impact, or maybe Rockwell Extra Bold. His years of staring at the ocean had given him a nice even tan, and when asked to describe himself in letters to pen friends he would tend to note that he was &#x2018;all teeth and curls&#x2019; but with &#x2018;a pleasant, open face&#x2019;.1 And most strikingly of all, he wore a great luxuriant beard that the pirates knew had inspired at least one book of epic poetry, because the Captain had personally dictated it on an adventure when it had been too rainy to get up to much else. <br><br>&#x2018;Sorry, Pirate Captain,&#x2019; said the albino pirate, who knew that they weren&#x2019;t supposed to fight at the breakfast table. &#x2018;We didn&#x2019;t mean to disturb you. We were just discussing what the best thing to do with a drunken pirate is. You know how we can never seem to decide.&#x2019; <br><br>The Pirate Captain looked thoughtful. &#x2018;The best thing to do with a drunken pirate,&#x2019; he said firmly, &#x2018;is to give him some strong black coffee.&#x2019; <br><br>And with the argument settled, the Pirate Captain grabbed a tray of breakfast and strode back towards his office. <br><br>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s right,&#x2019; said the pirate with gout. &#x2018;That makes a lot more sense. I don&#x2019;t actually know what &#x201c;soaking him in a barrel until he grows flippers&#x201d; even means.&#x2019; <br><br>The Pirate Captain sat back down at the desk in his office, or &#x2018;nerve centre&#x2019; as he had been trying to encourage the men to call it, on account of that sounding more exciting. The cabin was decorated with all kinds of maps, charts, calendars, trophies and at least half a dozen portraits. There was one of the Pirate Captain with a large white whale, the latter smiling weakly and waving its tail. There was a painting of him wearing a string vest and holding a ship&#x2019;s wheel in each hand to draw attention to the musculature in his arms and chest; and another showed him from the rear, walking across a tennis court and scratching his behind. Then there were the gifts from the crew &#x2013; a series of commemorative plates that depicted famous pirate haircuts, a wind chime made out of miniature cutlasses, a tea towel with &#x2018;10 Facts About Pirates&#x2019; and so on. Even the Captain occasionally got tired of the persistent nautical theme, but he didn&#x2019;t have the heart to tell the men to be a little more imaginative in future. His pirates genuinely loved him, in a manly, shoulder-punching kind of way, and in turn he felt a genuine affection towards his crew. He liked to think of himself as a kind of maritime goatherd, responsible for keeping his pirate goats fed with goat food and warding off wolves and that. The Captain was still working on the metaphor and hoped to share it with them all one day. It had occurred to him to try keeping some actual wolves hidden on the boat and then to set them free to give him an excuse to bring up the whole goatherd-analogy thing, but he wasn&#x2019;t sure where you could get wolves from. He&#x2019;d certainly never seen any for sale anywhere. The Captain made a mental note: &#x2018;Ask number two where I can buy some wolves. Preferably ravening.&#x2019; Then he went back to reading nautical trivia off the side of his cereal box, because that was where he got most of his seafaring knowledge. <br><br>There was a tap at the door, and the pirate with a scarf and Jennifer came in looking excited. Jennifer had been with the pirates for a while now, and she was beginning to blend in. She&#x2019;d lost some of her characteristic Victorian-lady traits, like wearing corsets that crushed your womb or having hysterical illnesses at the drop of a hat and, eager to be a good pirate, she&#x2019;d also passed on some of her more charming habits to the crew &#x2013; it was now a common sight to see pirates brushing their hair a hundred times before bed or self-consciously correcting their posture by walking about with a book on their head. <br><br>&#x2018;Hello, Pirate Captain,&#x2019; said Jennifer. <br><br>&#x2018;Hello there,&#x2019; said the Captain. He pointed at his cereal box. &#x2018;Did you know that, according to this, pirates wear patches to aid their view of the stars at night? Isn&#x2019;t that something?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;The world of trivia is amazing,&#x2019; agreed the pirate with a scarf. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ve got the morning paper for you.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Oh, well, just the cartoon section for me, thanks.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;I think you should see the front page, sir.&#x2019; <br><br>The Captain glanced up at the paper Jennifer was holding and frowned. &#x2018;&#x201c;Communist Dingo Ate My Baby&#x201d;?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Next to that.&#x2019; <br><br>Fishing his glasses out from under a sextant, the Pirate Captain began to read: <br><br>EAGLES <br>Admiral Sedgwick spoke exclusively to this newspaper about his horrific ordeal: &#x2018;We were minding our own business, knocking about the ocean, when a huge flotilla of pirate ships sailed out of the fog. They swooped down like eagles in eye patches, waving cutlasses and gnashing their gold teeth.&#x2019; <br><br>SKIN <br>Though hopelessly outnumbered, our brave&nbsp; Admiral managed to get his officers to safety in a launch. The pirates were led by the ruthless Pirate Captain, who was described by eyewitnesses as&nbsp; all teeth and curls but with a pleasant, open face and devilish flashing eyes. He was accompanied by a cackling pirate wearing a scarf made from human skin. &#x2018;When that hellhound gave the order to hole the ship, I looked into his eyes and saw a man without a soul,&#x2019; reports Admiral Sedgwick. Many fine sailors went to a watery grave. <br><br>The Pirate Captain, who is of indeterminate age and no fixed address, apparently took up pirating in a misguided attempt to impress a girl. <br><br>&#x2018;I like the bit about your eyes flashing,&#x2019; said Jennifer. &#x2018;Can you actually make them flash on and off?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;When the mood takes me,&#x2019; said the Pirate Captain, looking pleased. <br><br>&#x2018;And is it true about you taking up pirating to impress a girl?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Oh, sort of,&#x2019; said the Captain. &#x2018;Truth is, I&#x2019;m a little tired of telling that anecdote.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Is that human skin?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; said the pirate with a scarf. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s chinchilla. Nice and warm.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Funny thing is,&#x2019; said the Pirate Captain, knitting his bushy eyebrows together, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t really remember us having an exciting sea battle yesterday.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;No, Captain,&#x2019; said the pirate with a scarf, picking a barnacle off the electroplated pirate with an accordion, who was stood in the corner of the office. &#x2018;If you recall, we were going to have an exciting battle, but then you got chatting with that admiral and we decided it would be a lot less bother if we just had a competition to see who could eat the most crackers instead.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Oh, yes,&#x2019; said the Captain, brightening. &#x2018;That was good. Like at Christmas when the two armies play football with each other.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;But we were all so engrossed in the cracker contest that nobody was really paying attention to where the boats were going, and the Royal Navy boat ran straight into that iceberg.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Aaaarrr. That was unfortunate. Cut through the bow like it was butter, didn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Yes, sir.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;You don&#x2019;t suppose the bow was actually made from butter, though?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;No, sir. Butter is rarely used in naval construction.&#x2019; <br><br>The Captain shook his head. &#x2018;Icebergs. You know, if I didn&#x2019;t already have that fiend Black Bellamy as a nemesis, I think the position could very well be taken by icebergs.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re certainly a nuisance,&#x2019; said the pirate with a scarf. <br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t like the way you can&#x2019;t see their eyes,&#x2019; added the Captain grimly. &#x2018;There&#x2019;s something really malevolent about that, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Um. Icebergs aren&#x2019;t creatures, Pirate Captain.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Well, what in the Pirate King&#x2019;s name are they, then?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s when water freezes.&#x2019; <br><br>The Pirate Captain&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x2018;This is what I like about life at sea. It&#x2019;s one long voyage of discovery. Solid water! What will they think of next? Hopefully a pony who solves crimes. Anyhow, you&#x2019;re quite right, I do remember now &#x2013; we offered them a lift back to port, but he didn&#x2019;t think it would do his reputation much good to be seen with the likes of us. You can see his point. Nice chap that admiral. I like to think that in a different life we might have been friends. Though, of course, in a different life we might both have been moths, or pigs, or something like that. Who&#x2019;s to say?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Who indeed, Captain.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;But if he had been a pig and I was a moth, it would be nice to suppose that we could still get along. You know . . . I&#x2019;d flap my wing at him as I flew past and let him know when he had swill on his nose and so on. Having said that, the bit about me being &#x201c;a man without a soul&#x201d; is a little hurtful.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;I suspect he was probably trying to make things look a bit better to the newspapers than they actually were,&#x2019; said Jennifer. &#x2018;Understandable, really.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Aarrrr,&#x2019; said the Pirate Captain, reading through a bit more of the article. &#x2018;I certainly wouldn&#x2019;t want to get on the wrong side of me if that&#x2019;s the kind of behaviour I get up to. Look &#x2013; at one point I decapitated six sailors with a single swing from my cutlass. And I had the strength &#x201c;more of a lion than a mortal man&#x201d;.&#x2019; The Captain made a lion noise. <br><br>&#x2018;But that&#x2019;s not all, sir,&#x2019; said the pirate with a scarf, looking pleased. &#x2018;Because you also got sent this parcel.&#x2019; <br><br>In the Pirate Captain&#x2019;s experience parcels had been a bit of a mixed blessing. He&#x2019;d had good things come in parcels, like a nice T-shirt from Coney Island, a stuffed crow and a mug of hot tea, but he&#x2019;d also had some bad things, like a pile of mouldy potatoes, a hideous porcelain horse and a gauntlet that had turned out to be haunted. Luckily, this was definitely one of the good kind of parcel because it contained a letter, some tins of hair pomade and a small chest of treasure. <br><br>&#x2018;Why are people sending us treasure, Captain?&#x2019; asked Jennifer, opening up the chest. <br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s from the good people at Perkins&#x2019; Gentlemen&#x2019;s Pomade,&#x2019;2 explained the Pirate Captain, waving the letter at them. &#x2018;It seems that due to my new-found fame and notoriety they&#x2019;re proposing to sponsor our adventures. All I have to do is occasionally mention what a fine product they produce and how I couldn&#x2019;t live a day without it, that kind of thing, and in return they&#x2019;ll send us a monthly stipend, in the form of jewels and gold doubloons and that.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Oh, that is nice,&#x2019; said the pirate with a scarf. &#x2018;There are too few heart-warming moments at sea.&#x2019; <br><br>Jennifer tried on a tiara from the chest. It suited her. &#x2018;What are you going to spend it on, Captain?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;How about some new sails?&#x2019; said the pirate with a scarf, practical as ever. He tried on a different tiara, but the emeralds clashed with his scarf. &#x2018;Or portholes that don&#x2019;t let the water in; that would be nice.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;I think we have to prioritise, number two,&#x2019; said the Captain gravely. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s all very well wanting luxuries like new sails or portholes with glass in them, but there are also much more pressing necessities. Like me getting a nice new coat.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;You only got that coat last week, Captain!&#x2019; said Jennifer with a frown. &#x2018;For that pirate conclave in Nassau. I remember because Cut-throat Jenkins had exactly the same design. It was something of a social faux pas.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Ah, but you see, it&#x2019;s ruined. Probably in last night&#x2019;s exciting sea battle,&#x2019; said the Pirate Captain. He held up the hem of his coat, where a tiny piece of stitching had come loose. <br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s only a small tear,&#x2019; said the pirate with a scarf. &#x2018;I can mend that in no time. Remember that adventure where we set up a Bond Street fashion house and Black Bellamy had a rival fashion house and we competed in London Fashion Week?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;The one where my daring take on traditional tailoring took the fashion world by storm and Black Bellamy cheated by copying the exact same designs and managed to get them on to the catwalk just before we did?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Yes, that&#x2019;s the one. Anyway, I picked up quite a few sewing skills.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s good of you, but I think this damage is beyond repair, number two.&#x2019; The Pirate Captain grabbed the bottom of his coat and tore it another foot and a half. &#x2018;See? That could happen at any time. I definitely need a new one. So we&#x2019;ll stop off in London, give the lads some shore leave and get me a new coat. Don&#x2019;t worry, after that we&#x2019;ll have some sort of adventure &#x2013; hopefully something light involving a heist or a missing dinosaur skeleton. Or perhaps something to do with a barnyard. Have we ever had an adventure in a barnyard?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think so, sir,&#x2019; said the pirate with a scarf.</p><h2>Bonnard (World of Art)</h2><p>Bonnard found early fame among the Nabis, the radical young disciples of Gauguin, and went on with Vuillard to create a new intimist art of psychologically charged interiors. But from 1900 he turned back toward Impressionism, and his art recreates moments of heightened subjectivity, color and space. This new account shows how these beautiful and lyrical pictures sometimes emerged from terrible circumstances; as Bonnard himself wrote shortly before his death in 1947, &#34;one does not always sing out of happiness.&#34; Bonnard&#39;s reassessment over the past thirty years has centered on the extraordinary late pictures that were inspired by Mallarme and Symbolism, by Jarry and anarchism, and by the philosophy of Bergeson. These works are among some of the most enduring images of the twentieth century. 169 illus., 50 in color.</p><p>Pierre Bonnard (1867-1947) is acknowledged as one of the great masters of twentieth-century painting. Best-known as a painter of intimate, domestic interiors, he was also a highly accomplished draughtsman and graphic artist who produced a wealth of drawings and lithographs. In fact Bonnard began his career as a graphic artist, producing posters and illustrations for such magazines as La Revue Blanche. Associated with Maurice Denis, Edouard Vuillard and other members of the Nabis group from 1890, his early work is characterized by a tendency towards broad, flat colour and asymmetrical composition derived from Gauguin and from Japanese prints. From 1900 his palette became richer and his subject-matter settled into a range of obsessive themes - principally landscapes, nudes and interiors - in which he explored ever more complex formal problems and developed an unparalleled mastery of colour and light. His mature work achieves a level of dazzling intensity which has ensured his enduring reputation as one of the twentieth century&#39;s great colourists. In this important reassessment of Bonnard&#39;s life and work, Nicholas Watkins argues that Bonnard was not a sentimental survivor of impressionism as some have claimed, but a highly demanding and innovative artist responding to new formal challenges. Paintings, graphic work and sketches are comprehensively reproduced and examined in depth, providing a definitive study of this highly influential but frequently misunderstood artist.Timothy Hyman is a painter and a regular contributor to The Times Literary Supplement, Burlington Magazine, and elsewhere.</p><h2>Palindrome</h2><p><blockquote><p>Palindrome</p><p>When both your past and future spell fear.</p></blockquote><p>Award-winning author Stuart Woods has crafted a masterful novel no reader will soon forget.

Lynn Harris and Terry McMillan has been hailed as an indication that an active African American reading public has come into being. Yet this is not a new trend; there is a vibrant history of African American literacy, literary associations, and book clubs. <i>Forgotten Readers</i> reveals that neglected past, looking at the reading practices of free blacks in the antebellum north and among African Americans following the Civil War. It places the black upper and middle classes within American literary history, illustrating how they used reading and literary conversation as a means to assert their civic identities and intervene in the political and literary cultures of the United States from which they were otherwise excluded. <p></p><p><i>Forgotten Readers</i> expands our definition of literacy and urges us to think of literature as broadly as it was conceived of in the nineteenth century. Elizabeth McHenry delves into archival sources, including the records of past literary societies and the unpublished writings of their members. She examines particular literary associations, including the Saturday Nighters of Washington, D.C., whose members included Jean Toomer and Georgia Douglas Johnson. She shows how black literary societies developed, their relationship to the black press, and the ways that African American women&#x2019;s clubs&#x2014;which flourished during the 1890s&#x2014;encouraged literary activity. In an epilogue, McHenry connects this rich tradition of African American interest in books, reading, and literary conversation to contemporary literary phenomena such as Oprah Winfrey&#x2019;s book club.</p></p><p>"Forgotten Readers focuses upon an aspect of African American culture that was extraordinarily significant in the development of its literary tradition and in its political and social development as well, but, one that, as Elizabeth McHenry notes, has been ignored or simplistically described. This book will be instrumental in challenging and changing some erroneous notions about African American history and literature specifically, and American culture in general."&#x2014;Frances Smith Foster, author of Written by Herself: Literary Production by African American Women, 1746&#x2013;1892 <p>"Elizabeth McHenry&#x2019;s Forgotten Readers is a seminal study of the pivotal role that literary societies played in the shaping of American African culture in the nineteenth century. While many scholars knew of the existence of these societies, most of us had presumed their records to be lost or non-existent. Through meticulous research, McHenry has managed to reconstruct the nature and function of these curious arenas of literary culture in splendid detail. The study is a major contribution to the history of literacy in the African American community.

W. Dunne&#39;s and Albert Einstein&#39;s views on time and relativity, and the lives and works of Saint Augustine and James Joyce, both of whom have speaking parts in the novel. Bewildering? Yes, but as O&#39;Brien insists, &#34;a measure of bewilderment is part of the job of literature.&#34;</p><p>Flann O&#39;Brien, whose real name was Brian O&#39;Nolan, also wrote under the pen name of Myles na Gopaleen.

He walks you through the steps in the life of a business -- from entrepreneurial infancy, through adolescent growing pains, to the mature entrepreneurial perspective, the guiding light of all businesses that succeed -- and shows how to apply the lessons of franchising to any business, whether or not it is a franchise. Finally, Gerber draws the vital, often overlooked distinction between working on your business and working in your business. After you have listened to <em>The E-Myth Revisited</em>, you will truly be able to grow your business in a predictable and productive way.</p></p><p>Michael Gerber's <i>The E-Myth Revisited</i> should be required listening for anyone thinking about starting a business or for those who have already taken that fateful step. The title refers to the author's belief that entrepreneurs--typically brimming with good but distracting ideas--make poor businesspeople. He establishes an incredibly organized and regimented plan, so that daily details are scripted, freeing the entrepreneur's mind to build the long-term success or failure of the business. You don't need an M.B.A. to understand or follow its directives; Gerber takes time to explain buzzwords and complex theories. Read in a clear and well-paced manner, listening to <i>The-E Myth</i> is like receiving advice from an old friend. <i>--Sharon Griggins</i><p><strong>Michael E.

We are awed by mountains, challenged by the ocean, haunted by the bleakness of deserts. The effect of landscape on human consciousness is at the heart of novelist Paul Watkins's exhilarating travel story. Long bewitched by the stark beauty of the Scandinavian Alps, Watkins sets off among the ice-clad peaks and dark fjords of the arctic with only a tent and rucksack. On the way, he stops at rustic inns, follows the paths of other solitary travelers, navigates the punishing weather, and confronts the magisterial presence of the past among these mountains--a journey that makes for one of our finest accounts of the life and the land in the frozen north.</p></p><p><p><b>Paul Watkins</b> is the author of ten novels and the memoir <i>Stand Before Your God</i>.

And then, on the last day of 1995, the strip ended. Its mercurial and reclusive creator, Bill Watterson, not only finished the strip but withdrew entirely from public life. </p><p>In Looking for Calvin and Hobbes, Nevin Martell sets out on a very personal odyssey to understand the life and career of the intensely private man behind Calvin and Hobbes. Martell talks to a wide range of artists and writers (including Dave Barry, Harvey Pekar, and Brad Bird) as well as some of Watterson's closest friends and professional colleagues, and along the way reflects upon the nature of his own fandom and on the extraordinary legacy that Watterson left behind. This is as close as we're ever likely to get to one of America's most ingenious and intriguing figures - and it's the fascinating story of an intrepid author's search for him, too.</p></p><p>Nevin Martell is the author of <i>Looking for Calvin and Hobbes: The Unconventional Story of Bill Watterson and His Revolutionary Comic Strip</i> (Continuum, 2009), <i>Standing Small: A Celebration of 30 Years of the LEGO Minifigure</i> (DK, 2009), <i>Dave Matthews Band: Music for the People</i> (Pocket, 2004) and <i>Beck: The Art of Mutation</i> (Pocket, 2001).

He interviews former syndicate employees, comic strip artists from the past and present, and some of Watterson's closest confidants. By doing so, Martell walks a fine line between diligent journalist and obsessive fan. But his journey is a reminder that some things can't be recaptured, no matter how much we may wish otherwise." <br>-The New York Times, "The Moment" blog<br><br>"This story of Nevin Martell's search for the elusive Bill Watterson, the J.D. Salinger of the cartoon world, is so richly infused with the spirit of "Calvin and Hobbes," the genuine innocence and affection and humor, it doesn't even matter that the author never meets his subject. Watterson has never allowed the licensing of his work &#x2014; no merchandise, no TV, no movies. After doing a few interviews in the 1980s, he wrote a "manifesto against celebrity": "People love to have you, and then they use you up and there's nothing left." Early on, Martell wrote Watterson, who disappeared from public life after he stopped writing the strip in 1995, but never heard back. Discouraged but determined, he researched Watterson's life, interviewed friends, editors, even Watterson's mother, visited Watterson's childhood home in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, talked with other cartoonists, studied the influence of Peanuts, Krazy Kat, Pogo and Winnie the Pooh and pondered the effect of "Calvin and Hobbes" on his own life. Is this a definitive biography? No. But it's in many ways better and truer to the spirit of Watterson's creation."<br>-The Los Angeles Times Book Review<br>"This is essential reading for die-hard Calvin and Hobbes fans who want to stalk Watterson. Martell will give you all the reasons why you will never find the man. So instead of attempting something both discourteous and criminal, read this book instead."<br>-The San Francisco Book Review<br>"Nevin Martell has written a curious book, although one would probably best consider it a biography. Bill Watterson so consistently shunned the media that one is put in mind of the Shakespeare biography industry in which a few facts are churned in an attempt to generate a larger picture of a life...

I say, plunge them into the hive,</i><br><i>&amp; his hands go in.</i>-from "Blind Huber"</p><p>Blindness does not deter Fran�ois Huber-the eighteenth-century beekeeper-in his quest to learn about bees through their behavior. Through an odd, but productive arrangement, Huber's assistant Burnens becomes his eyes, his narrator as he goes about his work. In Nick Flynn's extraordinary new collection, Huber and Burnens speak and so do the bees. The strongest virgin waits silently to kill the other virgins; drones are "made of waiting"; the swarm attempts to protect the queen. It is a cruel existence. Everyone sacrifices for the sweet honey, except the human hand that harvests it all in a single afternoon.</p><p><i>Blind Huber</i> is about the body, love, and devotion and also about the limits of what can be known and what will forever be unknown. Nick Flynn's bees and keepers-sometimes in a state of magnificent pollen-drunk dizziness-view the world from a striking and daring perspective.</p></p><p><p><b>Nick Flynn</b>'s first collection of poems, <i>Some Ether</i>, received numerous awards, including the 1999 "Discovery" /<i> The Nation</i> Award and the 1999 PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award for Poetry, as well as several other prizes and honors.

In his ravishing and award-winning debut, <i>Some Ether</i> (2000), he portrayed a boy coping with his young mother's suicide. Here, in a radical departure, Flynn imaginatively enters the rarefied existence of a French eighteenth-century beekeeper named Francois Huber, who, in spite of going blind during childhood, conducted groundbreaking studies of the hidden dynamics of hive life with the help of an assistant remembered only as Burnens. As fascinated by the bees' points of view as by Huber's phenomenal ability to divine their ways through sound, touch, and smell, Flynn writes with exquisite delicacy and transporting agility not only of the blind apiarist's vivid perceptions but also of the experiences of drones, workers, and queens. Spellbound within wax edifices beneath a honey rain, Flynn succinctly and resonantly contrasts the dense and thrumming bee realm with our own buzzing, bittersweet world of avid appetites and aggression, longing and valor.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Donna Seaman, Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is a work of the creative imagination unlike any other.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Stanley Kunitz</i></p></p><h2>A Greek Alphabetarion: A Primer for Teaching How to Read, Write &amp; Pronounce Ancient &amp; Biblical Greek</h2><p>Before we can learn a language, we must master its alphabet. Yet many Greek grammars spend little time teaching the symbols and sounds of the Greek alphabet. Failure to master the basics of a language -- its spelling and phonics rules -- will cripple our progress in mastering the whole language. This new edition of A Greek Alphabetarion has been thoroughly revised and reformatted to make it easier for parents to teach their children, and for older students to learn by themselves. A syllabary (practice blending consonants and vowels) and a chrestomathy (practice reading sample passages) have been added in this new edition. A Greek Alphabetarion teaches the Greek alphabet in alphabetical order, letter by letter, using a rhythmic cadence to aid the student&#39;s memorization. Then, it teaches the alphabet in phonetic order, classifying each letter by its sound. A Greek Alphabetarion helps the student step-by-step to master reading Greek before moving on to study Greek grammar. Suitable for all ages, child through adult, in homeschools, private schools, colleges, and seminaries. Pronunciation CD included. Designed to be accompanied by A Greek Hupogrammon: A Beginner&#39;s Copybook for the Greek Alphabet with Pronunciations by Harvey Bluedorn.</p><p>Author Harvey Bluedorn and his wife Laurie started homeschooling their children in the late 70&#39;s and have given workshops on homeschooling and classical education for support groups and at conventions across the country. Their publishing company, Trivium Pursuit, produces books and curricula to help parents use classical education in their homeschool. Harvey Bluedorn has also authored Handy English Encoder Decoder, A Greek Hupogrammon, Homeschool Greek Volume I, Homeschool Greek Volume II (currently in beta version -- 2008), Ancient History from Primary Sources: A Literary Timeline, A Basic Exegetical and Expository Grammar of Biblical Greek, Vocabulary Bridges from English to Latin and Greek, Teaching the Trivium: Christian Homeschooling in a Classical Style, and Stephanus 2000 in Unicode: The Traditional Greek Text with Full Diacritical Markings. The Bluedorns live in New Boston, Illinois.First, in learning Greek, one must learn the alphabet. To memorize the 24 Greek capital letters and 25 small letters is not hard. One can do it in a day or two. But Mr. Bluedorn is not satisfied with that as an introduction to Greek. He proceeds to teach the student the sounds so he or she can pronounce the letters, and finally the words, as you read. This gives one the proper foundation, for to learn the parts, the sounds, and the symbols prepares the student to thoroughly handle the Greek Language. So, he says, read your lessons out loud; engage your mouth, your ears, hands, and eyes. This is the old-fashioned way of learning. And it works! In our judgment this is an excellent way to study Greek. In fact, this reviewer plans to go through it in order to more thoroughly understand the Greek of the New Testament. . . Please do yourself a favor, learn Greek. It sharpens the mind. . . . --Jay P.

My kids might fight over the last scoop of ice cream, but not school books. They started leaving little notes for each other in Greek letters and became quite competitive. The ending selections from the Gospel of John were sufficient to encourage my older son to continue to study on his own after he completed the primer. I attended graduate school at the University of Notre Dame and graduated in 1989 and was the Director of Forensic (Speech and Debate) while a graduate student there. I have been a faculty member at St. Mary's College, IN; Eastern Illinois University, University of Illinois, Washington State University, and the University of Alaska Fairbanks prior to homeschooling my children. I have held administrative positions at the University level. I have worked in the area of Educational Support Materials for several principles textbooks in the field of Economics such as earlier editions Ruffin and Gregory and Parkin. I am not readily impressed by curriculum materials for either the University, Secondary, or Primary grades or for homeschool. It is not uncommon for me to re-write material my children's use. This is one of the few programs that I have bought that required NO re-writing work on my part. In fact, I've never had to re-write any materials authored by the Bluedorns that I have purchased. I have always received more than fair value. --Barbara Haney Martinez, Ph.D.<br><br>Do you wonder if learning Greek is worthwhile? Harvey Bluedorn answers, Yes, Greek is worthwhile. Greek sharpens the mind, the language is useful for serving the Lord, and studying Greek is a preparation for revival. The next question: Can you learn Greek? Bluedorn answers once again, Yes! He describes A Greek Alphabetarion as an easy start with Greek. Students of all ages will study each Greek letter, in both the book and the accompanying CD. Then, they will transliterate words, and read selected biblical passages. Part three, the Greek Phonetic system for advanced students (who are at least ten years old), includes mutes, semi-vowels, and a chart of Greek phonetics. An appendix, The History of Languages, includes Japhetic languages, Hellenistic Greek, and biblical Greek. Bluedorn believes typical Greek grammars devote very little time or space to teaching Greek literacy. Instead, they expect students to master Greek literacy while they are studying Greek grammar. This is possibly true, in some instances. I did not note that problem, however, as I enjoyed Greek in seminary. A Greek Alphabetarion could smooth the way. I recommend this book as the first step to serious study...especially for anyone overwhelmed by languages.

He follows them - into the wild depths of the rainforest. When he realizes he is lost, it is already too late.<br><br>Stranded and helpless, McIntyre must adjust to an alien way of life. Gradually, he finds his perception of the world beginning to change, and a strange relationship starts to develop with the Mayoruna chief - is McIntyre really able to communicate with the headman in a way that goes beyond words, beyond language?&nbsp;Petru Popescu's gripping account of McIntyre's adventures with the Mayoruna tribe, and his quest to find the source of the Amazon, is reissued here to coincide with Complicite's acclaimed new stage production inspired by McIntyre's incredible story.</p><p>Born in Bucharest in 1944, Petru Popescu was Communist Romania's most provocative young novelist, before he was forced to defect and start writing in English. His Romanian novels <i>Captured</i> and <i>Burial of the Vine</i> are classics of the resistance against totalitarian art. Moving to the United States, he wrote movies including <i>The Last Wave</i> and <i>Death of an Angel</i>, before returning full time to authoring books. <i>The Encounter: Amazon Beaming</i>, <i>Almost Adam</i>, <i>The Return</i>, and <i>The Oasis</i> made him known worldwide. In <i>The Encounter</i>, he renders the discoverer of the Amazon's source, Loren McIntyre, as an unforgettable protagonist for his unique experiences in the rain forest among indigenous people, and for his inward explorations, pursuing the potential to win one's spiritual freedom. Freedom is clearly Popescu's signature motif. He is married to screenplay writer Iris Friedman, and they live in Los Angeles.<br><br>Born in London in 1957, Simon McBurney is an actor, director and writer, as well as the founder and artistic director of the acclaimed UK theatre company Complicite, whose productions include <i>The Master and Margarita</i> and <i>A Disappearing Number</i>.The strange and wonderful tale of National Geographic photographer Loren McIntyre's mystical journal from the depths of the Amazon basin to the river's ultimate source in the Andes, solemnly related by Popescu (The Last Wave; In Hot Blood, 1988 paperback.) With 40 years of Amazon exploration under his belt, as well as subsidiary careers in the US Navy and as a documentary filmmaker, McIntyre jumped at the chance to experience and photograph a ``first contact'' with an elusive Mayoruna tribe rumored to exist on the shores of the Rio Javari, an Amazon tributary. Airdropped onto the river's shore, McIntyre easily joined up with the seminomadic ``cat people''--who tattooed their faces and stuck spines in their cheeks to resemble their claimed jaguar ancestors- -but soon became hopelessly lost following their flight from an unseen enemy. Worried that his hired pilot would never find him, unable to speak the Indians' language, and suffering severe culture shock from jungle life, McIntyre nevertheless became fascinated by the Mayoruna headman, who seemed to communicate with the American through what McIntyre called ``beaming''--or mental telepathy. McIntyre apparently received mental messages regarding the tribe's plan to escape modern encroachers by traveling ``back to the beginning''--fasting, dancing, and ingesting natural hallucinogens to return to the safety of the beginning of time. After witnessing this ceremony, McIntyre returned to civilization, but he would experience a psychic reunion with the tribe--and, perhaps, their ancient ancestors--two years later while combing the Andes for the true source of the Amazon. Three stories--McIntyre's contact with the Mayoruna, his discovery of the Amazon's source, and his own inner, spiritual exploration--make for an occasionally unwieldy bundle of a book, but Popescu's awe, combined with McIntyre's general stupefaction, makes for fascinating reading. A sort of Castaneda exercise in mystical and ecological inquiry, perfectly timed for the New Age. (Sixteen pages of color photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Ordinary men, women, and children are the targets of entities that seem to spring from the depths of the collective unconscious, pop-cultural avatars some call demons. There&#x2019;s the Truth, implacable avenger of falsehood. The Captain, brave and self-sacrificing soldier. The Little Angel, whose kiss brings death, whether desired or not. And a string of others, ranging from the bizarre to the benign to the horrific.<br><br>As a boy, Del Pierce is possessed by the Hellion, an entity whose mischief-making can be deadly. With the help of Del&#x2019;s family and a caring psychiatrist, the demon is exorcised . . . or is it? Years later, following a car accident, the Hellion is back, trapped inside Del&#x2019;s head and clamoring to get out.<br><br>Del&#x2019;s quest for help leads him to Valis, an entity possessing the science fiction writer formerly known as Philip K. Dick; to Mother Mariette, a nun who inspires decidedly unchaste feelings; and to the Human League, a secret society devoted to the extermination of demons. All believe that Del holds the key to the plague of possession&#x2013;and its solution. But for Del, the cure may be worse than the disease.<br><b><br></b>&#x201c;Look out, Lethem!

Someone else said, No, it&#x2019;s the Painter&#x2014;the Painter or the Fat Boy.<br><br>The river of people leaving the gates had log-jammed against a line of cops, and rumor rippled back through the crowd. A demon had possessed a man, and O&#x2019;Hare security had sealed off the concourse between the gates and baggage claim. Reactions varied from exasperation to excitement. It was another travel delay, but at least it was an interesting delay.<br><br>I could see nothing beyond the end of the crowd but the cops&#x2019; blue shoulders and the cavernous space of the United terminal. We couldn&#x2019;t go back: we&#x2019;d just come through security, and more travelers were filling in behind us. There was nothing to do but wait for the demon to finish its business.<br><br>I dropped my blue nylon duffel bag between my feet and sat astride it, surrounded by a forest of legs and luggage. The scraping sensation in my head, quiet since morning, started up again. I stared at my shoes and tried to take clarifying breaths. My last doctor was big on clarifying breaths&#x2014;that, and heavy meds.<br><br>I was tired. I&#x2019;d been traveling all day, flying standby and catching one flight for every three, portaging the duffel through three airports, three sets of security shakedowns. At least I wasn&#x2019;t Japanese. Those poor bastards were practically strip-searched at every gate.<br><br>Someone backed into me, stumbled, and moved aside. I looked up, and the crowd shifted backward like spooked cattle. A path opened through the bodies, and suddenly I was alone in the middle of an aisle with the possessed man running toward me.<br><br>He was naked to the waist, his skinny chest and arms coated with gray dust, eyes wide and happy. He grinned, his mouth making words I couldn&#x2019;t hear. I got out of his way, leaving my bag in the middle of the floor.<br><br>He veered suddenly toward a popcorn vendor cart. Parents yanked children out of his way; people scattered. The crowd&#x2019;s mood had lurched from morbid curiosity to outright fear. A demon five hundred yards away was a lot different than one in your face.<br><br>He grabbed the cart by its handles and tipped it easily with the cartoon strength of the possessed. Someone screamed. The glass case shattered. Yellow popcorn blossomed into the air, and a metal pan bounced off the tile and rolled away like a hubcap.<br><br>The possessed man cackled and began to scoop up the popcorn, ignoring the shards of glass. He rose into a squat, arms full, and winked at me conspiratorially. His hands were bloody. He staggered back the way he&#x2019;d come, hunched over his load. The cop let him pass without making a move.<br><br>What else could he do? He couldn&#x2019;t shoot the guy. It wasn&#x2019;t his fault, and if they obstructed him the demon might get pissed, jump to someone else (like a cop with a gun), and start hurting people. Nothing to do but keep the gawkers back and wait for it to burn itself out.<br><br>I picked up my bag and walked forward&#x2014;plenty of room at the front of the line now&#x2014;until I&#x2019;d reached the temporary barrier, a ribbon of nylon strung between plastic posts. There was no one between me and the demon but a line of cops.<br><br>The United terminal was an art deco cathedral of steel and glass, shining ribs arcing under blue glass. I&#x2019;d always liked it. The demon, trailing puffs of popcorn, shuffled to the middle of the concourse, stopped between the Starbucks and the shrine to the Kamikaze, and opened his arms. The popcorn spread over the marble with a susurrant huff.<br><br>He surveyed the mess for a moment, and then began to dance. He crushed the popcorn beneath his glossy black shoes. He paused, then danced again. When he was satisfied he dropped to hands and knees and began pushing the yellow powder into the borders of his sand painting, his collage, his sculpture&#x2014;whatever the hell it was.<br><br>What it was, though, was a farm: a quaint white farmhouse, a red silo and barn, a line of trees, wide open fields. The farmhouse was powdered detergent or sugar or salt; the silo bits of red plastic and glass that could have been plucked from smashed exit signs; the trees cunningly arranged candy wrappers and strips of Styrofoam from coffee cups and junk food packages. The crumbled popcorn became the edge of a wheat field. The picture was simultaneously naturalistic and hazily distorted, a landscape seen through waves of heat.<br><br>The demon began to add details. I sat down on my duffel and watched him work. He fiddled with the shards of red glass to suggest the warp of barn wood; gently blew the white powder into the ghosts of gutters and window frames; scraped his shoe heel against the marble to create a smudge above the house that could have been a cloud or a large bird. The longer he worked, the more familiar the scene became. I&#x2019;d never seen the place before&#x2014;at least, I didn&#x2019;t remember ever seeing a farm like this&#x2014;but the picture was so relentlessly quaint, so Norman Rockwell, that maybe it was the idea of the farm that I recognized. The Jungians thought demons were archetypes from the collective unconscious. Perhaps the subject matter of archetypal artists was archetypes.<br><br>And then he abruptly stood and walked away, not even glancing back at the finished picture. The man took maybe a dozen steps, and then collapsed. No one moved for perhaps a minute.<br><br>Finally a cop edged forward, his hand on his nightstick, and asked the man questions I couldn&#x2019;t catch. The man looked up, frightened. The cop helped him to his feet, and the man looked at his cut hands, then around at the crowds. The cop put an arm around his shoulder and led him away.<br><br>. . .<br><br>&#x201c;Del!&#x201d;<br><br>Lew, My Very Bigger Brother, bellowing from the other end of the atrium. His wife, Amra, shook her head in mock embarrassment. This was part of their shtick: Lew was loud and embarrassing, Amra was socially appropriate.<br><br>Lew met me halfway across the floor and grabbed me in a hug, his gut hitting me like a basketball. He&#x2019;d always been bigger than me, but now he was six inches taller and a hundred pounds heavier. &#x201c;Jesus Christ!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What took you so long? The board said your flight got in an hour ago.&#x201d; His beard was bushier than when I&#x2019;d last seen him a year and a half ago, but it had still failed to colonize the barren patches between ear and chin.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry about that&#x2014;something about four bags of heroin up my ass. Hey, Amra.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Del.&#x201d;<br><br>I hugged her briefly. She smelled good as always. She&#x2019;d cut her long, shiny black hair into something short and professional.<br><br>Lew grabbed the strap from my shoulder and tried to take it from me. &#x201c;I got it,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, you look like you haven&#x2019;t slept in a week.&#x201d; He yanked it from me. &#x201c;Shit, this is heavy. How many more bags do you got?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you, a fuckin&#x2019; hobo? Okay, we have to take a shuttle to the parking garage. Follow me.&#x201d; He charged ahead with the duffel on his back.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you hear there was a demon in the airport?&#x201d; Amra said.<br><br>&#x201c;I was there. They wouldn&#x2019;t let us out of the terminal until he was gone. So what happened to the Cher hair?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh . . .&#x201d; She made a gesture like shooing a fly. &#x201c;Too much. You saw it? Which one was it&#x2014;not the Kamikaze?&#x201d; The news tracked them by name, like hurricanes. Most people went their whole lives without seeing one in person. I&#x2019;d seen five&#x2014;six, counting today&#x2019;s. I&#x2019;m lucky that way.<br><br>&#x201c;The Painter, I think. At least, it was making a picture.&#x201d;<br><br>Lew glanced back, gave Amra a look. He wanted her to stop talking about it. &#x201c;Probably a faker,&#x201d; Lew said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a possession conference going on downtown next week. The town&#x2019;ll be full of posers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think this guy was faking,&#x201d; I said. That mad grin. That wink. &#x201c;Afterward he was just crushed. Totally confused.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wonder if he even knows how to draw,&#x201d; Amra said.<br><br>The tram dropped us at a far parking lot, and then we shivered in the wind while Lew unlocked the car and loaded my duffel into the tiny trunk.<br><br>It was new, a bulbous silver Audi that looked futuristic and fast. I thought of my own car, crumpled like a beer can, and tried not to be jealous. The Audi was too small for Lew anyway. He enveloped the steering wheel, elbows out, like he was steering with his stomach. His seat was pushed all the way back, so I sat behind Amra. Lew flew down 294, swearing at drivers and juking between lanes. I should have been used to Lew&#x2019;s driving by then, but the speed and erratic turns had me gripping the back of Amra&#x2019;s seat. I grew up in the suburbs, but every time I came back to Chicago I experienced traffic shock. We were forty minutes from downtown, and there were four crammed lanes on each side of the road, and everyone moving at 70 mph. It was worse than Denver.<br><br>&#x201c;So what have you been doing with yourself?&#x201d; Lew asked. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t call, you don&#x2019;t write, you don&#x2019;t send flowers . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We missed you at Christmas,&#x201d; Amra said.<br><br>&#x201c;See, Lew? From Amra, that actually means she missed me at Christmas. From you or Mom that would have meant &#x2018;How could you have let us down like that?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then she said it wrong.&#x201d;<br><br>They&#x2019;d only been married for a year and a half, but they&#x2019;d been dating on and off&#x2014;mostly on&#x2014;since college. &#x201c;So when are you guys going to settle down and make Mom some multiracial grandbabies? The Cyclops has gotta be demanding a little baby action.&#x201d;<br><br>Amra groaned. &#x201c;Do you have to call her that? And you&#x2019;re changing the subject.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Lew said. &#x201c;Back to your faults as a son and brother. What have you been up to?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s a funny story.&#x201d;<br><br>Lew glanced at me in the rearview mirror. Amra turned in her seat to face me, frowning in concern.<br><br>&#x201c;Jeez, guys.&#x201d; I forced a smile. &#x201c;Can you at least let me segue into this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Amra said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a big deal. I had a car accident in November, went through a guardrail in the snow, and then&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Lew snorted in surprise. &#x201c;Were you drunk?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fuck you. The road was icy, and I just hit the curve too fast and lost control. I went through the rail, and then the car started flipping.&#x201d; My gut tightened, remembering that jolt. My vision had gone dark as I struck the rail, and I&#x2019;d felt myself pitching forward, as if I were being sucked into a black well. &#x201c;I ended up at the bottom of a ravine, upside down, and I couldn&#x2019;t get my seatbelt undone.&#x201d; I left out the caved-in roof, the icy water running through the car, my blind panic. &#x201c;I just hung there until the cops got me out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Weren&#x2019;t you hurt?&#x201d; Amra asked.<br><br>I shrugged. &#x201c;My arms were scraped up, and my back was killing me, but that turned out to be just a pulled muscle. They kept me in the hospital for a day, and then they let me go. And afterward . . . well, all in all I was pretty lucky.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lucky?&#x201d; Lew said. &#x201c;Why do people say that? You get a tumor, and if it turns out that you can operate on it, people say, gee, that was lucky. No, lucky is not getting cancer. Lucky is not getting cancer, then finding ten bucks in your shoe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you done?&#x201d; Amra said.<br><br>&#x201c;He totaled his car. He&#x2019;s not that lucky.&#x201d;<br><br>Amra shook her head. &#x201c;You were about to say something else, Del. What happened after the accident?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, afterward.&#x201d; I suddenly regretted bringing it up. I&#x2019;d thought I could practice on Lew and Amra, get ready for the main event with Mom. Amra looked at me expectantly.</p><h2>Chess Exam And Training Guide: Rate Yourself And Learn How To Improve (Chess Exams)</h2><p>This book offers a unique approach to chess self-evaluation and training.

In this sermon, Rev. Mayhew explained that Romans 13 does not require Christians to submit to tyranny and that, in fact, the Bible clearly places a duty upon Christians to resist tyrannical rulers.

I smoked cigarettes and lay on the bed. I wanted her to drop by in the afternoon for a nap. It didn&#x2019;t seem likely and this was part of my pleasure, like the agony of fixating on a dead movie star the way I&#x2019;d become obsessed at age fifteen with the long-decomposed actress Vivien Leigh, a.k.a. Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara, and her later, more bummed-out incarnation, Blanche DuBois. Instead of rock stars, I had pictures of Vivien all over my room, glossy publicity shots and film stills I&#x2019;d ordered or simply received in the mail, gifts from sad obsessives who advertised, as I did, in the back pages of Nostalgia, Illustrated, a creepy classic-movie magazine for shut-ins and losers that I&#x2019;d stumbled across on the racks at Consumer&#x2019;s Supermarket while leafing through Seventeen and holding my breath against the stench from the sugar beet factory reigning over adjacent fields. At night I lay awake in sadness, grieving that Vivien had died alone, coughing herself to death consumptively long before I was old enough to intervene. She was a great actress,&#x201d; I said morosely to my friends, trying to visualize her having sex with Laurence Olivier, an image not so easy, really, to wrap your mind around. Part of her allure was the fact that she spelled Vivien&#x201d; with an e, not an a, the e more refined and seductive, the a somehow thudding and crude, witness the barbarian Vivian Vance.<br> <br>In one of the photos tacked up inside my teenage closet, Vivien leans into the lens and smiles, glamorous in the low-cut red velvet robe she wore in Gone With the Wind when Rhett takes her upstairs and rapes her, at which point she blossoms into the fullness of her love. The shot&#x2019;s a medium close-up taken as she relaxes on the set, in her hand a cigarette, she&#x2019;s smoking. Each day after school I'd lock my bedroom door, open the closet, and stand with my peanut butter sandwich, staring into Vivien's green eyes as if my gaze, held long enough, could jump-start the pulse in her throat, compel the hand with that cigarette off the page and up to my lips to offer me a drag, her body following to step gracefully into my room, suspended tobacco smoke drawn back into the chamber of her mouth as she starts to breathe again for real. Jesus, I couldn&#x2019;t imagine: Mom vacuuming the same spot suspiciously outside my door while inside there&#x2019;s this movie star thing looking into your eyes. Oh my god you just want to be the smoke pulled between her lips. What happens when you get inside a person anyway, up that close, inside their mouth? It&#x2019;s like a photograph blown up. They just dissolve into a haze of black and white dots until all you have is molecules and air, nothing there.<br><br>That day on the sidewalk you lifted your arm above your head. There in the hollow the wispy dark hairlets, I couldn&#x2019;t breathe. I lit a cigarette, walked inside a building. Dreamily I got through my task, propelled by shots of adrenaline at the thought of your name. The job was easy, I didn&#x2019;t care. I drifted home, not minding the sidewalk, the wreckage percolating around me. Your name is Jane. I floated through my door, lit a cigarette, my nerves were black. I thought I might buy some drugs and call you up.<br><br> I&#x2019;m a Scorpio,&#x201d; Vivien explained to a reporter, and we Scorpios are like that: we eat ourselves up and burn ourselves out.&#x201d; At fifteen, I lumbered numbly through various hallways from my bedroom to the kitchen, from the snack bar to math. In geometry I sat there flunking and stared with loathing at my forearm: it looked so meaty. Whenever the guy next to me glanced over, I hid it in my lap. I had long, thin limbs but in my mind I was a sausage, the wrapping stretched tight to bursting with a putrid, ground-up meat inside. I pictured the finespun Vivien huddled in the corner of a darkened hotel room in Rome, abandoned by Olivier, career on the rocks, cold flames rolling off her, burning alive in the firestorm of her manic depression. I watched the scorpion stinger on her tail, stuck in her own throat and convulsively pushing poison into her neck.

Lloyd III occupied its massive Canterbury pulpit as dean during an often- turbulent period in the nation and rapid changes in American religious life. <br><br>In Sermons from the National Cathedral, Dean Lloyd provides a compelling vision of an intellectually alive, publicly engaged Christian faith, a vision of the Christian life rooted in ancient teaching. Readers will find the sermons engaging and appreciate that Dean Lloyd takes seriously the experiences of doubt and searching that are so much a part of the modern religious experience of our time. He successfully demonstrates the positive role faith can play in public life and addresses the questions and challenges faith must face in the twenty-first century. <br><br>These soundings, as Lloyd calls them, illumine the full spectrum of Christian belief while also addressing such issues as the difficulty of faith, the relationship between science and faith, the mystery of suffering, the necessity of forgiveness, the meaning of the cross, the urgency of reconciliation, and the call to care for the earth. These reflections will appeal to traditional Christians seeking spiritual enrichment and are accessible to those seeking answers to how their faith fits into our modern world.</p><p>Samuel T. Lloyd III is a priest of the Episcopal Church in the United States who served as the ninth Dean of the Washington National Cathedral, having been installed there on April 23, 2005, and serving until September 18, 2011. Before his tenure as Dean, Samuel Lloyd previously served as rector of historic Trinity Church, Copley Square in Boston, Massachusetts, one of the largest Episcopal congregations in the United States. He returned to Trinity after leaving the National Cathedral. Lloyd has taught in seminaries and has frequently spoken at conferences and conventions. He has preached on the &#x201c;Protestant Hour&#x201d; on radio and offered courses in the area of Christianity and literature, including Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, Dante, contemporary fiction, C. S. Lewis, and the parables. He served as a regent of the University of the South. His writing and reviews have been published by the Sewanee Theological Review, Forward Movement, Anglican Digest, and Journal of Religion, among others.<br>Lloyd was a highly effective rector at Boston&#x2019;s historic Trinity Church before being elevated to the post of dean at Washington&#x2019;s National Cathedral in 2005. Then, to the surprise of all concerned, he returned to Trinity as priest-in-charge in September 2011: rising in the church means more administration and less preaching, it seems. And Lloyd relished preaching. These sermons, from the cathedral&#x2019;s Canterbury pulpit to an ever-shifting congregation of visitors, tourists, and dignitaries, exhibit the finest homiletics of a denomination not generally praised for great preaching. In an era that Lloyd recognized as one in which we are approaching religion in an &#x201c;increasingly individualistic, more private and eclectic&#x201d; manner, he sought to demonstrate &#x201c;a new work of the Spirit,&#x201d; responsive to our times. The sermons here are arranged thematically into three &#x201c;Books&#x201d;: &#x201c;Reflections on Faith,&#x201d; &#x201c;Events and Issues&#x201d; (including his sermon for President Obama&#x2019;s first inauguration), and &#x201c;Church Year.&#x201d;A mirror of important times in the history of the Episcopal Church and the nation, these sermons will be of interest to most Episcopalians and most seminaries. With a foreword by Jon Meacham. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>As someone who is both a full time pastor and preacher as well as writer I know full well how hard it is, seemingly impossible at times, to offer a word of hope, encouragement, and inspiration on a weekly basis. There are times when I feel high and dry yet I need to muster up a word about The Word to my congregation. Reading these sermons was an act of lectio divina for me, or slow divine or meditative reading. . . .If you are a pastor and in need of some inspiration or a serious Christian who likes to read and reflect upon Scripture then look no further than Sermons From the National Cathedral. You won't be disappointed. (<i>Walking with God</i>)<br><br>Lloyd's style is marked by clarity of exposition, tight writing, only enough quotations to suddenly arouse interest, and topicality without the subjects becoming quickly out of date. These are well-crafted works that deserve repeated reading in whole or in part, as can serve a mediations for daily prayer. ... In rereading the sermons it is possible to savor Lloyd's considerable skills as an expository writer. (<i>Anglican and Episcopal History</i>)<br><br>This collection of Samuel T. Lloyd III&#x2019;s sermons from the National Cathedral provide a clear voice of a &#x201c;generous-spirited Christianity&#x201d; (immediate and accessible) which is deeply needed in this new century. He sees the heart of the gospel as the gift and call to be fully human and he preaches not only with grace, but with a canny sense of the struggles of the age. His is a stealth radicalism of compassion, which comes in under the radar, often catching the reader unawares with its clarity and challenge, with its bite and risk. <br>These sermons are the product of a literary and generous imagination combining intellectual rigor with simple charity in assuring his readers of the abiding goodness at the heart of things. It&#x2019;s as if he&#x2019;s saying over and over again, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t lose heart!&#x201d; Good news in a time when the heart seems to have been knocked out of things. And what is at the heart of these sermons? A sense of the sacred, and affirmation of the holy, an affirmation of hope in a time when many fear, with the poet Philip Larkin, that, in the end, there is &#x201c;no sight, no sound,?/No touch or taste or smell, /nothing to think with,?/Nothing to love or link with.&#x201d; Lloyd preaches Good news. (Alan W. Jones, Dean Emeritus, Grace Cathedral, San Francisco; author of Soul Making)<br><br>Even though they were delivered from the lofty pulpit at the National Cathedral, these sermons land squarely at our feet precisely where the "rubber meets the road." They are biblically based, intellectually exciting and spiritually alive and send us on our way with new vision and hope. (Tim Johnson, M.D., Senior Medical Contributor, ABC News; author of Finding God in the Questions)<br><br>In this compelling and delightful book, Samuel T. Lloyd III has given the world an extraordinary gift. Lloyd is probably the finest preacher in the Episcopal Church; and in this book, we are provided with a faithful, generous, thoughtful account of the Christian drama. Be prepared to cry, think, and laugh. Lloyd is not simply a careful reader of Scripture, but he connects Scripture with a wider canon of literature and art. You don't simply read this book, you study it and allow it to make a real difference to way you look at the world. (The Very Rev. Dr. Ian Markham, dean and president of Virginia Theological Seminary)<br><br>Samuel Lloyd's sermons provide rich fare for hungry souls, and they bear repeated reading and reflection. Drawing frequently from the world of literature, Lloyd deftly invites his hearers to explore the vagaries of the human spirit as it encounters and is overtaken by the Divine. God's ways with us are such that the most ordinary and seemingly unexceptional can become the means of revelation. (The Right Rev. Frank T. Griswold, XXV Former Presiding Bishop and Primate of the Episcopal Church)<br><br>These sermons preached by Samuel Lloyd from the Canterbury pulpit of the National Cathedral encourage in us all a love for the Gospels and help us to find Jesus in a multitude of different situations in daily life. The illustrations which Sam uses to preach profound and challenging truths are endlessly imaginative and drawn from his great love of literature and also quarried from his own journey of faith. This book will be helpful alike to those who read it and to those of us who, like Lloyd, preach the word of God to others. (The Very Rev. Dr. Robert Willis, DL, Dean of Canterbury)<br><br>The Very Reverend Samuel Lloyd III is a stunningly gifted teacher and preacher. Powerful, relevant and immensely thought-provoking, Sermons from the National Cathedral reminds us that the basic tenets of faith, love, acceptance, compassion, respect and forgiveness have always been, and will continue to be, the means by which mankind can face even its darkest challenges. Sermons from the National Cathedral inspires, illuminates and leads the reader to a life of higher purpose and to a mission of more devoted spiritual understanding.

In this unprecedented memoir, eight siblings (plus one by marriage) tell their remarkable stories in individually authored chapters that comprise a family saga of revolution, persistence, and, ultimately, vindication, even as easy resolution eluded their struggles.<br><br><i>Subversive Lives</i> tells of attempts to smuggle weapons for the New People&#x2019;s Army (the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines); of heady times organizing uprisings and strikes; of the cruel discovery of one brother&#x2019;s death and the inexplicable disappearance of another (now believed to be dead); and of imprisonment and torture by the military.

In Joseph A. Conforti's engrossing retelling, the case of Lizzie Borden, sensational in itself, also opens a window on a time and place in American history and culture. <br><br>Surprising for how much it reveals about a legend so ostensibly familiar, Conforti's account is also fascinating for what it tells us about the world that Lizzie Borden inhabited. As Conforti&#x2014;himself a native of Fall River, the site of the infamous murders&#x2014;introduces us to Lizzie and her father and step-mother, he shows us why who they were matters almost as much to the trial's outcome as the actual events of August 4, 1892. Lizzie, for instance, was an unmarried woman of some privilege, a prominent religious woman who fit the profile of what some characterized as a "Protestant nun." She was also part of a class of moneyed women emerging in the late 19th century who had the means but did not marry, choosing instead to pursue good works and at times careers in the helping professions. Many of her contemporaries, we learn, particularly those of her class, found it impossible to believe that a woman of her background could commit such a gruesome murder. <br><br>As he relates the details, known and presumed, of the murder and the subsequent trial, Conforti also fills in that background. His vividly written account creates a complete picture of the Fall River of the time, as Yankee families like the Bordens, made wealthy by textile factories, began to feel the economic and cultural pressures of the teeming population of native and foreign-born who worked at the spindles and bobbins. Conforti situates Lizzie's austere household, uneasily balanced between the well-to-do and the poor, within this social and cultural milieu&#x2014;laying the groundwork for the murder and the trial, as well as the outsize reaction that reverberates to our day. As Peter C. Hoffer remarks in his preface, there are many popular and fictional accounts of this still-controversial case, "but none so readable or so well-balanced as this."</p><p>Joseph A. Conforti is Distinguished Professor of American and New England Studies Emeritus at the University of Southern Maine in Portland. He is the author of several books, including the award-winning <i>Imagining New England: Explorations of Regional Identity from the Pilgrims to the Mid-Twentieth Century</i> and <i>Another City upon a Hill</i>, a memoir of growing up in Lizzie Borden&#x2019;s hometown."Conforti writes in the prologue that he has approached "the crime as more than a murder mystery" but his writing is so beautiful and the story so compelling that at many points the book actually reads like a novel. but it is history, good historical scholarship."--<i><b>New England Quarterly</b></i><p>"[Conforti] explores considerations of ethnicity, class, and gender and how these shaped the investigation, the reporting, the trial, and public understanding."--<i><b>Reviews in American History</b></i></p><p>"Thoroughly researched and fascinating."--<i><b>Register of the Kentucky Historical Society</b></i></p><p>"Conforti's <i>Lizzie Borden on Trial</i> is the scholarly treatment that the subject has been awaiting. . . .

These men and women are now dead, but their story lives on in the collective memory of their tribe.<br><br> Gus Bighorse lived through that period of his people's history, and his account of it&#x2014;recalled by his daughter Tiana and retold in her father's voice&#x2014;provides authentic glimpses into Navajo life and values of a century ago. Born around 1846, Gus was orphaned at sixteen when his parents were killed by soldiers, and he went into hiding with other Navajos banded together under chiefs like Manuelito. Over the coming years, he was to see members of his tribe take refuge in Canyon de Chelly, endure the Long Walk from Fort Defiance to Bosque Redondo in 1864, and go into hiding at Navajo Mountain. Gus himself was the leader of one of Manuelito's bands who fought against Kit Carson's troops.<br><br> After the Navajos were allowed to return to their land, Gus took up the life of a horseman, only to see his beloved animals decimated in a government stock reduction program.<br><br> "I know some people died of their tragic story," says Gus. "They think about it and think about how many relatives they lost. Their parents got shot. They get into shock. That is what kills them. That is why we warriors have to talk to each other. We wake ourselves up, get out of the shock. And that is why I tell my kids what happened, so it won't be forgot." Throughout his narrative, he makes clear those human qualities that for the Navajos define what it is to be a warrior: vision, compassion, courage, and endurance.<br><br> Befitting the oral tradition of her people, Tiana Bighorse draws on her memory to tell her father's story. In doing so, she ensures that a new generation of Navajos will know how the courage of their ancestors enabled their people to have their reservation today: "They paid for our land with their lives." Following the text is a chronology of Navajo history, with highlights of Gus Bighorse's life placed in the context of historical events.</p><p>Tiana Bighorse is a Navajo weaver who lives in Tuba City, Arizona. Noel Bennett came to the Navajo reservation in 1968 and studied weaving with Tiana for eight years, which initiated a lifelong friendship. Noel Bennett is also the author of <i>Halo of the Sun; </i>both are authors of <i>Working with the Wool. </i>"A series of moving stories about an heroic and compassionate man&#x2014;and the sufferings and endurance of the Navajo people." &#x2014;<i>Studies in American Indian Literatures</i><br><br> "A testimonial to the strength of the Navajo way of life. . . . Recommended for any reader who is interested in Native American ways." &#x2014;<i>Parabola</i><br><br> "The late Navaho warrior Gus Bighorse (born in 1846) passed stories and recollections on to his children. His colorful life, as remembered by daughter Tiana and retold in the voice of her father, is recounted in an unusual, illustrated volume. . . . This narrative makes clear those human qualities that define for the Navaho what it is to be a warrior, while also presenting the essence of Navaho culture." &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br> "A simple story that transcends the ages." &#x2014;<i>Journal of the West</i></p><h2>The White Bone: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>A thrilling journey into the minds of African elephants as they struggle to survive. </b></p><p>If, as many recent nonfiction bestsellers have revealed, animals possess emotions and awareness, they must also have stories. In <i>The White Bone</i>, a novel imagined entirely from the perspective of African elephants, Barbara Gowdy creates a world whole and separate that yet illuminates our own. </p><p>For years, young Mud and her family have roamed the high grasses, swamps, and deserts of the sub-Sahara. Now the earth is scorched by drought, and the mutilated bodies of family and friends lie scattered on the ground, shot down by ivory hunters. Nothing-not the once familiar terrain, or the age-old rhythms of life, or even memory itself-seems reliable anymore. Yet a slim prophecy of hope is passed on from water hole to water hole: the sacred white bone of legend will point the elephants toward the Safe Place. And so begins a quest through Africa's vast and perilous plains-until at last the survivors face a decisive trial of loyalty and courage. </p><p>In The White Bone, Barbara Gowdy performs a feat of imagination virtually unparalleled in modern fiction. Plunged into an alien landscape, we orient ourselves in elephant time, elephant space, elephant consciousness and begin to feel, as Gowdy puts it, "what it would be like to be that big and gentle, to be that imperiled, and to have that prodigious memory."</p></p><p>Barbara Gowdy has an utter affinity for the unconventional. In the title story of <i>We So Seldom Look on Love</i>, necrophilia is exquisite rather than execrable, and her wildly funny--and wildly affecting--novel <i>Mister Sandman</i> invites us into the hearts and minds of Toronto's least normal and most loving family. With <i>The White Bone</i> Gowdy continues her exploration of extraordinary lives, but this time human beings ("hindleggers") are on the periphery. And we're grateful when they're not around, since this gives her four-legged characters--elephants--a chance to survive.<p> <i>The White Bone</i> opens with five family trees. Gowdy's pachyderms include an orphaned visionary, She-Spurns (more familiarly known as Mud), and the "fine-scenter" She-Deflates, not to mention nurse cow She-Soothes and the bull Tall Time. (Though Gowdy's nomenclature may displease some readers, Dumbo wasn't exactly an inspiring name either.) Then, before her tragic narrative even begins, Gowdy offers a second feat of empathy and imagination, a glossary of elephant language. Afflicted by premonitions and obsessed with memory and safety, these animals have terms that range from the formal to the low, the metaphorical to the deeply physical: the "Eternal Shoreless Water" is oblivion, a "sting" is a bullet, and a "flow-stick" a snake. Of course, if you have "trunk," you possess "soulfulness; depth of spirit"--something every participant in Gowdy's fourth novel desperately needs. Initially, her characters' impressions of familiar objects are amusing, but bright comedy precedes dark tragedy. Witness Mud's take on jeeps: "On their own, vehicles prefer to sleep, but whenever a human burrows inside them they race and roar and discharge a foul odour." Needless to say, such speeding tends to precede a killing fest. </p><p> Alas, this is a book heavy with omens and slaughter, and Gowdy makes each elephant so individual, so conscious, that their separate fates are impossible to bear. When Tall Time, for instance, hears a helicopter, nothing, not even Gowdy's poetry, can save him: "The shots that pelt his hide feel as light as rain. It is bewildering to be brought down under their little weight." As the devastation increases, and her characters fail, and fail again, to find the magical white bone that should lead them to safety, the novel becomes a litany of pain and death. The only success is Barbara Gowdy's, in getting so thoroughly under the skin of her elephantine protagonists. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p><p><b>Barbara Gowdy</b> is the author of six previous books, and a new novel, <i>Helpless,</i> coming from Metropolitan Books in April 2007.

Her gorgeous designs are regularly featured in <i>Vogue Knitting</i> magazine and many other publications. She lives in Chatsworth, ON, Canada.&#x201c;Before the craze for hand-dyed yarn became a big business, there was Koigu, the Ontario-based company founded by the Landra family. Hand-painted in gorgeous, saturated colors, Koigu yarns were especially coveted during the early years of the current knitting renaissance, and one of the early knitalongs&#x2014;before the days of Ravelry&#x2014;was Maie Landra's Charlotte's Web shawl (which appears in this book). The shawls vary in size and complexity, from simple shawlettes to extravagantly detailed showpieces, and each design showcases the stunning colors that define the Koigu brand. The coauthors also celebrate their Estonian roots, incorporating elements of traditional Estonian lace into some of the shawls.

Full of wit and psychological poignancy, <i>A Fairly Good Time</i>, here with&nbsp;<i>Green Water,</i> <i>Green Sky</i>, encapsulates Gallant&#x2019;s unparalleled skill as a storyteller.&nbsp;<br><br> Shirley Perrigny (n�e Norrington, then briefly Higgins), the heroine of <i>A Fairly Good Time</i>, is an original. Derided by the Parisians she lives among and chided by her fellow Canadians, this young widow&#x2014;recently remarried to a French journalist named Philippe&#x2014;is fond of quoting Jane Austen and Kingsley Amis and of using her myopia as a defense against social aggression. As the fixed points in Shirley&#x2019;s life begin to recede&#x2014;Philippe having apparently though not definitively left&#x2014;her freewheeling, makeshift, and self-abnegating ways come to seem an aspect of devotion to her fellow man. Could this unreliable protagonist be the unwitting heroine of her own story?<i>&nbsp;</i><br><br> <i>Green Water, Green Sky</i>, Gallant&#x2019;s first novel, is a darker tale of the fractured family&nbsp;life of Bonnie McCarthy, an American divorc�e, and her daughter, Flor. Uprooted and unmoored, mother and daughter live like itinerants&#x2014;in Venice, Cannes, and Paris&#x2014;glamorous and dependent. With little hope of escape, Flor attempts to flee this untidy life and the false notes of her mother.</p><p><b>Mavis Gallant </b>(1922&#x2013;2014) was born in Montreal and worked as a journalist at the <i>Montreal Standard</i> before moving to Europe to devote herself to writing fiction. In 1950, after traveling extensively she settled in Paris, where she would remain for the rest of her life. Over the course of her career Gallant published more than one hundred stories and dispatches in <i>The New Yorker</i>. In 2002 she received the Rea Award for the Short Story and in 2004, the PEN/Nabokov Award for lifetime achievement. In addition to <i>A Fairly Good Time</i>, New York Review Books Classics publishes three collections of Gallant&#x2019;s short stories: <i>Paris Stories</i>, <i>Varieties of Exile</i>, and <i>The Cost of Living: Early and Uncollected Stories</i>.<br><br> <b>Peter Orner</b> is the author of two collections of stories, <i>Last Car Over the Sagamore Bridge</i> and <i>Esther Stories</i>, and two novels, <i>Love and Shame and Love</i> and <i>The Second Coming of Mavala Shikongo</i>.

His book of nonfiction <i>Am I Alone Here?</i> will be published in November 2016. Orner has received Guggenheim and Lannan Foundation fellowships, and two Pushcart Prizes.

There was little kindness to be found in the press comments at the time. The exhibitions were not ready; the site was a dusty mess of building works; and almost everyone hated the giant statue over the entrance of a woman modeled on the actress Sarah Bernhardt and dressed in a fashionable evening dress. Yet the Exposition went on to be a triumph, with over 50 million visitors.<br><br>In style and content the Exposition partly celebrated the glories of the past and each nation displayed its national treasures&#x2014;whether paintings, sculptures, rare books or scrolls&#x2014;and its national activities. So where the Canadian pavilion had piles of furs, the Finnish showed lots of wood, and the Portuguese decorated their pavilion with ornamental fish. Many of the European pavilions mimicked great Gothic or Renaissance buildings, although little Switzerland built a chalet. The Chinese copied a part of the Forbidden City in Beijing and Siam (today Thailand) put up a pagoda. The Ottoman Empire, that dwindling but still great state which stretched from the Balkans in southern Europe through Turkey to the Arab Middle East, chose a pavilion which was a jumble of styles, much like its own peoples who included Christians, Muslims and Jews and many different ethnicities. With colored tiles and bricks, arches, towers, Gothic windows, elements of mosques, of the Grand Bazaar from Constantinople (now Istanbul), it was fitting that the overall result still somehow resembled the Hagia Sophia, once a great Christian church that became a mosque after the Ottoman conquest.<br><br>Germany&#x2019;s pavilion was surmounted by a statue of a herald blowing a trumpet, suitable, perhaps, for the newest of the great European powers. Inside was an exact reproduction of Frederick the Great&#x2019;s library; tactfully the Germans did not focus on his military victories, many of them over France. The western facade hinted, though, at a new rivalry, the one which was developing between Germany and the world&#x2019;s greatest naval power, Great Britain: a panel showed a stormy sea with sirens calling and had a motto rumored to be written by Germany&#x2019;s ruler, Kaiser Wilhelm II, himself: &#x201c;Fortune&#x2019;s star invites the courageous man to pull up the anchor and throw himself into the conquest of the waves.&#x201d; Elsewhere at the Exposition were reminders of the rapidly burgeoning power of a country that had only come into existence in 1871; the Palace of Electricity contained a giant crane from Germany which could lift 25,000 kilos.<br><br>Austria-Hungary, Germany&#x2019;s closest friend in Europe, had two separate pavilions, one for each half of what had come to be known as the Dual Monarchy. The Austrian one was a triumph of Art Nouveau, the new style which had been catching on in Europe. Marble cherubs and dolphins played around its fountains, giant statues held up its staircases and every inch of its walls appeared to be covered by gold leaf, precious stones, happy or sad masks, or garlands. A grand reception room was set aside for members of the Habsburg family which had presided for centuries over the great empire stretching from the center of Europe down to the Alps and Adriatic, and the exhibits showed off the work of Poles, Czechs, and South Slavs from the Dalmatian coast, only some of the Dual Monarchy&#x2019;s many peoples. Next to the Austrian pavilion and separating it from that of Hungary stood a smaller one, representing the little province of Bosnia, still technically part of the Ottoman Empire but administered since 1878 from Vienna. The Bosnian pavilion, with its lovely decorations by craftsmen from its capital of Sarajevo, looked, said the guide published by Hachette, like a young girl being brought out into the world for the first time by her parents.1 (And they were not particularly happy ones at that.)<br><br>The mood of the Hungarian pavilion was strongly nationalistic. (Austrian critics said sourly that the folk art on display was vulgar and its colors too bright.) The exhibits also included a reconstruction of the great citadel of Comorn (Kom�ron) in the north which stood in the way of the Ottomans in the sixteenth century as they stretched northwards into Europe. Much more recently, in 1848, it had been held by Hungarian nationalists in the revolt against the Habsburgs but had fallen to Austrian forces in 1849. Another room was dedicated to the Hussars, famous for their bravery in the wars against the Ottomans. The exhibits paid less attention though to the millions of non-Hungarian peoples, Croatians or Rumanians, for example, who lived within Hungary&#x2019;s borders.<br><br>Italy, like Germany a new country and a great power more by courtesy than in reality, had built what looked like a vast, richly decorated cathedral. On its golden dome stood a giant eagle, its wings outstretched in triumph. Inside it was filled with art from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, but the glories of the past could weigh heavily on a poor young country. Britain, by contrast, chose to be low key even though it still dominated much of the world&#x2019;s trade and manufacturing and had the world&#x2019;s biggest navy and largest empire. Its exhibit was housed in a cozy country house designed by rising young architect Edwin Lutyens in the half-timbered Tudor style and consisted mainly of English paintings from the eighteenth century. Some private British owners had refused to lend their works because Britain&#x2019;s relations with France, traditionally difficult, were particularly strained in 1900.2<br><br>Russia had pride of place at the Exposition as France&#x2019;s favored ally. The Russian exhibits were huge and scattered in several different locations, ranging from a massive palace in the style of the Kremlin dedicated to Siberia to a richly decorated pavilion named in honor of the Tsar&#x2019;s mother, Empress Marie. Visitors could admire, among much else, a map of France made in precious stones which the Tsar, Nicholas II, had sent as a present to the French and marvel at the sheer extent of the Romanovs&#x2019; possessions. The French themselves did not have their own pavilion; the whole Exposition was after all designed to be a monument to French civilization, French power, French industry and agriculture, and French colonies, and room after room in the different special exhibits was devoted to French achievements. The French section of the Palais des Beaux-Arts was, said the guide, naturally a model of good taste and luxury. The Exposition marked the reassertion by France that it was still a great power, even though only thirty years previously it had been utterly defeated as it had tried to prevent Germany coming into existence.<br><br>The Universal Exposition was nevertheless, the French declared, a &#x201c;symbol of harmony and peace&#x201d; for all of humanity. Although the more than forty countries exhibiting in Paris were mainly European, the United States, China, and several Latin American countries also had pavilions. As a reminder though of where power still lay, a large part of the Exposition was given over to colonies where the European powers showed off their possessions. The crowds could marvel at exotic plants and beasts, walk by replicas of African villages, watch craftsmen from French Indochina at their work, or shop in North African souks. &#x201c;Supple dancing girls,&#x201d; said an American observer severely, &#x201c;perform the worst forms of bodily contortions known to the followers of Terpsichore.&#x201d;3 Visitors came away with a comfortable assurance that their civilization was superior and that its benefits were being spread around the globe.<br><br>The Exposition seemed a suitable way to mark the end of a century which had started with revolutions and wars but which now stood for progress, peace and prosperity. Europe had not been entirely free of wars in the nineteenth century but they had been nothing to compare with the long struggles of the eighteenth century or the wars of the French Revolution and later those of Napoleon which had drawn in almost every European power. The wars of the nineteenth century had generally been short&#x2014;like the one between Prussia and the Austrian Empire which had lasted for seven weeks&#x2014;or colonial wars fought far from European soil. (The Europeans should have paid more attention to the American Civil War which not only lasted for four years but which gave an early warning that modern technology and the humble barbed wire and spades were shifting the advantage in war to the defense.) While the Crimean War in the middle of the century had involved four European powers, it was the exception. In the Austro-Prussian War, the Franco-Prussian, or the Russo-Turkish the other powers had wisely stayed out of the conflict and had done what they could to build peace again.<br><br>In certain circumstances war was still seen as a reasonable choice for nations if they could see no other way to obtain their goals. Prussia was not prepared to share control of the German states with Austria and Austria was determined not to concede. The war that followed settled the issue in Prussia&#x2019;s favor. Resorting to war was costly but not excessively so. Wars were limited both in time and in their scope. Professional armies fought each other and damage to civilians and to property was minimal, certainly in light of what was to come. It was still possible to attack and win decisive victories. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870&#x2013;71, though, like the American Civil War, hinted that armed conflict was changing: with conscription, armies were bigger, and better and more accurate weapons and increased firepower meant that the forces of the Prussians and their German allies suffered large casualties in the opening attacks on the French. And the surrender of the French army at Sedan did not end the fighting. Instead the French people, or large sections of it, chose to fight on in a people&#x2019;s war. Yet even that had finally ended. France and the new Germany had made peace and their relations had gradually mended. In 1900 the Berlin business community sent a message for the opening of the Exposition to the Paris Chamber of Commerce, wishing success to &#x201c;this great undertaking, which is destined to bring the civilized nations of the world nearer to one another in the labours common to them all.&#x201d;4 The large numbers of German visitors who were expected to go to Paris would, so many in Germany hoped, help to build better relations between the peoples of their two countries.<br><br>All the peoples of the earth have worked on the Exposition, said the special Hachette guide: &#x201c;they have accumulated their marvels and their treasures for us to reveal unknown arts, overlooked discoveries and to compete with us in a peaceful way where Progress will not slacken in her conquests.&#x201d; The themes of progress and the future ran throughout the Exposition, from the new moving pavements to the cinema in the round. At one of the pavilions, the Ch�teau d&#x2019;Eau, with its cascading waterfalls, shooting fountains, and colored lights playing on the waters, the centerpiece in a giant basin was an allegorical group which represented Humanity led by Progress advancing towards the Future and overthrowing the rather odd couple of Routine and Hatred.<br><br>The Exposition was a showcase for individual countries but it was also a monument to the most recent extraordinary achievements of Western civilization, in industry, commerce, science, technology, and the arts. You could see the new X-ray machines or be overwhelmed, as Henry James was, by the Hall of Dynamos, but the most exciting discovery of all was electricity. The Italian Futurist artist Giacomo Balla later called his daughters Luce and Elettricit� in memory of what he saw at the Paris Exposition. (A third daughter was Elica&#x2014;Propellor&#x2014;after the modern machinery he also admired.) Camille Saint-Sa�ns wrote a special cantata in praise of electricity for the Exposition: Le Feu c�leste with orchestra, soloists and choir was performed at a free concert. The Palace of Electricity was ablaze with 5,000 light bulbs and high on the summit of its roof stood the Fairy of Electricity in her chariot drawn by a horse and dragon. And there were dozens more palaces and pavilions devoted to the important activities of modern society, among them machinery, mining and metallurgy, chemical industries, public transportation, hygiene, and agriculture.<br><br>There was still more, much more. The second modern Olympic Games took place nearby in the Bois de Boulogne as part of the Exposition. Sports included fencing (where the French did very well), tennis (a British triumph), athletics (American dominated), cycling and croquet. At the Exposition Annexe in Vincennes you could examine the new motorcars and watch balloon races. Raoul Grimoin-Sanson, one of the earliest film directors, went up in his own balloon to film the Exposition from above. As the Hachette guide said, the Exposition was &#x201c;the magnificent result, the extraordinary culmination of the whole century&#x2014;the most fertile in discoveries, the most prodigious in sciences, which has revolutionized the economic order of the Universe.&#x201d;<br><br>In light of what was to come in the twentieth century such boasting and such complacency seem pitiful to us, but in 1900 Europeans had good reason to feel pleased with the recent past and confident about the future. The thirty years since 1870 had brought an explosion in production and wealth and a transformation in society and the way people lived. Thanks to better and cheaper food, improvements in hygiene, and dramatic advances in medicine, Europeans were living longer and healthier lives. Although Europe&#x2019;s population went up by perhaps as much as 100 million to a total of 400 million, it was able to absorb the growth thanks to increased output in its own industry and agriculture and imports from around the world. (And emigration acted as a safety valve to avoid an even more dramatic increase&#x2014;some 25 million Europeans left in the last two decades of the century for new opportunities in the United States alone and millions more went to Australia or Canada or Argentina.)<br><br>Europe&#x2019;s cities and towns grew as people moved from the countryside in increasing numbers in search of better opportunities in factories, shops and offices. On the eve of the French Revolution in 1789, Paris had some 600,000 inhabitants; by the time of the Exposition, 4 million. Budapest, the capital of Hungary, showed the most dramatic increase: in 1867 it had 280,000 inhabitants and by the time of the Great War, 933,000. As the numbers of Europeans making a living from agriculture went down, the industrial working classes and the middle classes grew. Workers organized themselves into unions, which were legal in most countries by the end of the century; in France the number of workers in unions went up fivefold in the fifteen years before 1900 and was to reach 1 million just before the Great War. In recognition of the increasing importance of the class, the Exposition had exhibits of model houses for workers and organizations for their moral and intellectual development.</p><h2>What Praise Can I Play on Sunday?

A few selections are less well known, such as Little Mouse and Lazy Cat and The Swans and the Brave Princess. Pirotta writes like a storyteller, with great imagery and description, and the lively stories read aloud beautifully. They are not as severe as those by the Grimms, which makes them suitable for a younger audience. In Snow White, for example, in the original version, the evil queen is forced to put on red-hot iron shoes at Snow White's wedding and dances to her death; here, her heart breaks into a thousand fragments as the mirror breaks. Pirotta also adds evocative descriptions, as in Hansel and Gretel: the forest echoed with the sound of hooting owls and howling wolves, which adds to the overall sense of fear. Clark's dark, twisty branches in the forest enhance the mood of this story. The large typeface, generous use of white space, and overall design make this book one children can read themselves, and the artist's expressive illustrations contribute to the appeal.

But is that concern misplaced? Authors and psychologists Patrick M. Markey and Christopher J. Ferguson say it is.<br><br>The media and politicians have been sounding the alarm for years, and with every fresh tragedy involving a young perpetrator comes another flurry of articles about the dangers of violent media. The problem is this: Their fear isn&#x2019;t supported by the evidence. In fact, unlike the video game trained murder machines depicted in the press, school shooters are actually <i>less likely</i> to be interested in violent games than their peers. In reality, most well-adjusted children and teenagers play violent video games, all without ever exhibiting violent behavior in real life. What&#x2019;s more, spikes in sales of violent games actually correspond to decreased rates of violent crime.<br><br>If that surprises you, you&#x2019;re not alone the national dialogue on games and violence has been hopelessly biased. But that&#x2019;s beginning to change. Scholars are finding that not only are violent games not one of society&#x2019;s great evils, they may even be a force for good.<br><br>In <i>Moral Combat</i>, Markey and Ferguson explore how video games even the bloodiest can have a positive impact on everything from social skills to stress, and may even make us more morally sensitive. Tracing the rise of violent games from arcades to online deathmatches, they have spent years on the front lines of the video game debate and now offer a comprehensive overview of the scientific research on gaming. With humor, complete honesty, and extensive research, they separate the myth from the medium.<br><br><i>Moral Combat</i> is an irreverent and informative guide to the worries and wonders of our violent virtual world.</p><p><strong>Dr. Patrick Markey</strong> is a Professor of Psychology, the Director of the Interpersonal Research Laboratory at Villanova University, and a former President of the Society for Interpersonal Theory and Research. Dr. Patrick Markey received his doctorate from the University of California (Riverside) in social and personality psychology, with a focus on behavioral statistics. Since receiving his degree he has published over sixty book chapters and journal articles in peer-reviewed journals, and he has made hundreds of presentations at universities and at national and international scientific conferences. Among his peers, he is widely recognized as an expert on how violent video games affect our behavior, and he is regarded for being able to present complex statistical and behavioral data to a general audience in a way that is both informative and entertaining. For years Dr. Markey has been involved in educating the general public and politicians about various psychological issues related to digital media. By giving talks at universities and elementary schools he has been able to help parents, teachers, and school administrators better understand the complex research examining violent video games.

Unique in its breadth and depth. Using examples and focusing on fundamentals, it clarifies long misunderstood issues-such as why today's markets are inherently unstable. The book reveals for the first time how uncoordinated regulatory and engineering policies cause boom-bust investment swings and provides guidance and tools for fixing broken markets. It also takes a provocative look at the operation of pools and power exchanges.<br> * Part 1 introduces key economic, engineering and market design concepts.<br> * Part 2 links short-run reliability policies with long-run investment problems.<br> * Part 3 examines classic designs for day-ahead and real-time markets.<br> * Part 4 covers market power, and<br> * Part 5 covers locational pricing, transmission right and pricing losses.<br> The non-technical introductions to all chapters allow easy access to the most difficult topics. Steering an independent course between ideological extremes, it provides background material for engineers, economists, regulators and lawyers alike. With nearly 250 figures, tables, side bars, and concisely-stated results and fallacies, the 44 chapters cover such essential topics as auctions, fixed-cost recovery from marginal cost, pricing fallacies, real and reactive power flows, Cournot competition, installed capacity markets, HHIs, the Lerner index and price caps.<br> <br> About the Author<br> Steven Stoft has a Ph.D. in economics (U.C.

But <i>appearances</i> deceive and produce false new economic theories&#x2014;e.g., competitive pricing cannot pay the cost of power plants. The <i>real</i> differences lie hidden and allow a blind faith that "the market" will solve all problems&#x2014;e.g., provide a reliable level of generation capacity. <p>I began the book knowing that much of this confusion could be cleared up by stripping away <i>apparent</i> differences to show that power markets usually work like normal markets. Economics does not need re-writing, only careful application. But power systems present some genuine puzzles. </p><p>Applying basic economics to <i>apparent</i> differences leads to familiar results. I have presented these results simply along with examples for the uninitiated. The same approach leads to surprising results when applied to <i>real</i> differences. For example, the demand side of today&#x2019;s power markets is quantitatively so different from standard text-book markets that it produces an unusual type of market failure. Part 2 of the book reveals how the lack of coordination between engineers and regulators, in controlling this failure, produces the headline-grabbing price spikes characteristic of current markets. </p><p>Part 3 analyzes day-ahead and real-time markets but also asks fundamental questions about the need for complex pools. Are their calculations subverted by the bids of speculators? Observations of Eastern pools suggest power-market design is still in its early stages. This book provides a simple yet solid foundation, diagnoses the problems that now threaten the existence of deregulated markets, and provides tools to help make repairs.</p><b>An Introduction to the Fundamental Economics of Power Market Design and Analysis</b> <p>Power System Economics is the first systematic presentation of power-market design principles from economic theory to market architecture. The approach is pragmatic, and the discussion illustrates economic and engineering fundamentals with simple examples. The volume breaks new ground in its analysis of price spikes, market-based unit commitment, and the prediction of market power. </p><p>Power System Economics includes five parts. Part 1 introduces key economic, engineering, and market design concepts. Part 2 explains how short-run reliability policies determine long-run average installed capacity and reliability. Part 3 examines classic designs for day-ahead and real-time markets. Part 4 covers market power, and Part 5 covers the effect of networks on prices. Topics include: </p><p>* How marginal-cost prices cover fixed costs<br> * Fundamentals of auction design<br> * The value of lost load (VOLL) as a price cap: theory versus practice<br> * Price limits, price spikes, investment, and reliability<br> * Standard market designs, including PJM<br> * Power pools versus power exchanges<br> * Market power fallacies and the HHI<br> * Losses pricing and congestion pricing</p></p><h2>Key Concepts in Childhood Studies (Sage Key Concepts series)</h2><p><p>This book has already proved itself as a course adoption leader in Childhood Studies.

Countless pundits insist that any call for legal simplification smacks of nostalgia, sentimentality, or naivet�. But the conventional view, the noted legal scholar Richard Epstein tells us, has it exactly backward. The richer texture of modern society allows for more individual freedom and choice. And it allows us to organize a comprehensive legal order capable of meeting the technological and social challenges of today on the basis of just six core principles. In this book, Epstein demonstrates how.</p><p>The first four rules, which regulate human interactions in ordinary social life, concern the autonomy of the individual, property, contract, and tort. Taken together these rules establish and protect consistent entitlements over all resources, both human and natural. These rules are backstopped by two more rules that permit forced exchanges on payment of just compensation when private or public necessity so dictates. Epstein then uses these six building blocks to clarify many intractable problems in the modern legal landscape. His discussion of employment contracts explains the hidden virtues of contracts at will and exposes the crippling weaknesses of laws regarding collective bargaining, unjust dismissal, employer discrimination, and comparable worth. And his analysis shows how laws governing liability for products and professional services, corporate transactions, and environmental protection have generated unnecessary social strife and economic dislocation by violating these basic principles.</p><p><i>Simple Rules for a Complex World</i> offers a sophisticated agenda for comprehensive social reform that undoes much of the mischief of the modern regulatory state. At a time when most Americans have come to distrust and fear government at all levels, Epstein shows how a consistent application of economic and political theory allows us to steer a middle path between too much and too little.</p></p><p>Richard A. Epstein is Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law at New York University School of Law, Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Law and Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School.A book called 'The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America' by attorney Philip Howard has captured the attention of Washington's policy community with its maddening accounts of overzealous regulation and complex litigation. But Mr. Howard's appeal for enforcing rules with a dose of common sense never sets forth a framework for bringing about legal simplification. That's why Richard Epstein's new book...is such a suitable companion to Mr. Howard's battle cry. Mr. Epstein...believes that the traditional common law is actually more attuned to the modern world...He argues that the more complex the world, the less bureaucrats and lawmakers can know about how everything interacts, and the more perverse and inefficient the law will become...Mr. Epstein's relentlessly logical arguments tell us why we should return to the tried-and-true rules of the common law. Like manners, the common law has proven useful and long lasting precisely because it is so well-suited to a world of strangers. (John H. Fund <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>Richard A. Epstein, a professor of law at the University of Chicago, has a record of proposing radical and extreme alterations in key areas of law--alterations that perhaps initially could be dismissed as so far from the center of legal thinking as to be of only theoretical interest but then turn out to have much more political life in them than one could have thought possible...Mr. Epstein has to be taken seriously, and not only because of the power of his reasoning and his authoritative command of the common law and political philosophy...The reasoning is strong, the knowledge of specific areas of policies is deep, and behind them stands his basic commitment to a more productive and efficient society...It is bracing to undergo a cold bath in the pure doctrine of the simple rules, and in many areas they will give us some practical guidance. (Nathan Glazer <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br><i>Simple Rules for a Complex World</i> is a clear, consistent, libertarian economic approach to the law that should keep you interested from start to finish. (Charles W. Chesbro <i>Trial</i>)<br><br>This book is a tour de force of legal history and analysis. It would have been timeless in any event, but the current Congress' agenda makes it timely as well. Property rights, product and professional liability, a flat tax and environmental protection are now front and center; labor law reform and comparable worth may soon crowd their way onto the agenda as well. Long-range vision and wisdom are too seldom combined with topical analysis, but <i>Simple Rules for a Complex World</i> has this invaluable quality...What Mr. Epstein has accomplished, then, is not the fabrication of a framework but the distillation of one. He has articulated and rationalized basic principles of law in a creative way that shows these principles to have both historical and theoretical primacy. At a time when much legal scholarship is devoted to the deconstruction of the root of our legal order, Mr. Epstein has written a book of reconstruction.

In this profound book, Ira Shor&#x2014;the inventor of critical pedagogy in the United States&#x2014;relates the story of an experiment that nearly went out of control.<br> <br> Shor provides the reader with a reenactment of one semester that shows what really can happen when one applies the theory and democratizes the classroom. This is the story of one class in which Shor tried to fully share with his students control of the curriculum and of the classroom. After twenty years of practicing critical teaching, he unexpectedly found himself faced with a student uprising that threatened the very possibility of learning. How Shor resolves these problems, while remaining true to his commitment to power-sharing and radical pedagogy, is the crux of the book. Unconventional in both form and substance, this deeply personal work weaves together student voices and thick descriptions of classroom experience with pedagogical theory to illuminate the power relations that must be negotiated if true learning is to take place.<br></p></p><p>Ira Shor has a dual appointment as Professor of English at the City University of New York Graduate School and at the College of Staten Island.

It is also a gripping narrative of human conflict, of nature as the overwhelming adversary, of terror and pain and death, and of final deliverance. In the service of the Russian tsarina, the German naturalist Steller accompanied the great Danish explorer Vitus Bering on a voyage that survived shipwreck and unimaginable hardship to mark the beginning of Alaska's recorded history. This book is a new translation and annotation of Steller's journal of that voyage and the first to be based completely upon a surviving copy of Steller's manuscript dated 1743 (previous translation had been based on a 1793 edition). The journal is the best known of Steller's writings, not so much because of events along the way, or its biological and anthropological observations, not even because of the momentous sight of the Alaskan coast and the subsequent landings, but because of the harrowing events of the return voyage. Thirty-two men of the 78 who set sail died, including Bering himself; 46 survived shipwreck in the winter of 1741-42 on a treeless, uninhabited island, and returned finally to home port on Kamchatka in a small vessel built from timbers of the wrecked ship. On the island, Bering and his lieutenant had become too ill to function and Steller found himself taking the lead in organizing work parties, finding antiscorbutic plant and animal food, nursing the six, and cheering the depressed&#x2015;actions that kept all from perishing.</p><p>The European discovery of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands is fully and dramatically recorded in this journal-a gripping narrative of human conflict, of nature as adversary, of terror and pain and death, and of final deliverance.O.W.

What occurred in the ensuing weeks and months has been the source of a tempestuous debate ever since. <br><br>It is well known that the Japanese military committed wholesale atrocities after the fall of the city, massacring large numbers of Chinese during the both the Battle of Nanjing and in its aftermath. Yet the exact details of the war crimes--how many people were killed during the battle? How many after? How many women were raped? Were prisoners executed? How unspeakable were the acts committed?--are the source of controversy among Japanese, Chinese, and American historians to this day. <br><br>In <em>The Making of the "Rape of Nanking</em> Takashi Yoshida examines how views of the Nanjing Massacre have evolved in history writing and public memory in Japan, China, and the United States. For these nations, the question of how to treat the legacy of Nanjing--whether to deplore it, sanitize it, rationalize it, or even ignore it--has aroused passions revolving around ethics, nationality, and historical identity. Drawing on a rich analysis of Chinese, Japanese, and American history textbooks and newspapers, Yoshida traces the evolving--and often conflicting--understandings of the Nanjing Massacre, revealing how changing social and political environments have influenced the debate. Yoshida suggests that, from the 1970s on, the dispute over Nanjing has become more lively, more globalized, and immeasurably more intense, due in part to Japanese revisionist history and a renewed emphasis on patriotic education in China. <br><br>While today it is easy to assume that the Nanjing Massacre has always been viewed as an emblem of Japan's wartime aggression in China, the image of the "Rape of Nanking" is a much more recent icon in public consciousness. Takashi Yoshida analyzes the process by which the Nanjing Massacre has become an international symbol, and provides a fair and respectful treatment of the politically charged and controversial debate over its history.<br></p><p>Takashi Yoshida is an Assistant Professor of History at Western Michigan University.<br>"Yoshida does the field a service in bringing myriad insights together in one manuscript.

Consequently, the 9/11 Commission made several recommendations on how to improve the quality of intelligence analysis. Those charges and the United States' involvement in a war in Iraq have spawned additional charges of the politicization of intelligence. All this is being played out as the Intelligence Community has reformed and reconfigured itself with newly created departments supported by an expanded and inexperienced workforce that was never envisioned when the intelligence community was formally established in 1947.<br><br>First published in the 1970s, the classic book <i>An Introduction to Intelligence Research and Analysis</i> was used by intelligence analysts to track and monitor the Communist threat. Although today's environment has changed considerably since the Cold War, intelligence analysts still need to understand the basics of intelligence analysis. The book focuses on how to do research, what qualities are needed to be an intelligence analyst, and what methods can be employed to help in producing products. To avoid politicization, intelligence analysts should strive to become more transparent in their methodology of how they arrived at their conclusions. <i>Intelligence Research and Analysis</i> provides several methods to assist in that end.</p><p>Jerome Clauser is the author of several publications on intelligence education and training.

MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson argued in 1967. In this book, the authors developed a general theory to explain the facts of island biogeography. The theory builds on the first principles of population ecology and genetics to explain how distance and area combine to regulate the balance between immigration and extinction in island populations. The authors then test the theory against data. <i>The Theory of Island Biogeography</i> was never intended as the last word on the subject. Instead, MacArthur and Wilson sought to stimulate new forms of theoretical and empirical studies, which will lead in turn to a stronger general theory. Even a third of a century since its publication, the book continues to serve that purpose well. From popular books like David Quammen's <i>Song of the Dodo</i> to arguments in the professional literature, <i>The Theory of Island Biogeography</i> remains at the center of discussions about the geographic distribution of species. In a new preface, Edward O. Wilson reviews the origins and consequences of this classic book.</p></p><p><p>"MacArthur and Wilson's is arguably the most influential book in biogeography in the last hundred years. With its emphasis on on-going processes of colonization and extinction, it provided a new framework to explain patterns in species diversity and served as a counterpoint to hypotheses relying on chance and solitary historical events. Many of the antecedents for what we now call conservation biology, invasion biology, and landscape ecology had their origins here."<b>--Ted Case, University of California, San Diego</b></p><b>Robert H.

It tends to undermine shared understandings about individuality and social obligations, sharpening the tension between the belief in personal autonomy and the domination of a powerful corporate culture.<br><br>Richly anecdotal and accessibly written, Leidner's book charts new territory in the sociology of work. With service sector work becoming increasingly important in American business, her timely study is particularly welcome.</p><p><b>Robin Leidner</b> is Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania.Leidner (sociology, Univ. of Pennsylvania) uses participant observation to explore aspects of service-industry efforts to insure sameness of effort and routinization of work. The author chooses for examples the ubiquitous McDonald's and the Combined Insurance Company, whose founder, W. Clement Stone, formulated the Positive Mental Attitude (PMA). Both companies achieve service provider-service recipient relationships that are routinized yet acceptable both to the customer and employee. The much-touted "worker rebellions" are largely nonexistent; many if not most employees prefer a well-choreographed approach to the point of sale.

On day one of an economics course a new student is taught the answer: to maximize shareholder profit. But this single idea that pervades all our thinking about the role of the corporation, is fundamentally wrong, argues Colin Mayer. Constraining the firm to a single narrow objective has had wide-ranging and damaging consequences; economic, environmental, political, and social. <br><br><em>Prosperity</em> challenges the fundamentals of business thinking. It also sets out a positive new agenda, demonstrating that the corporation is in a unique and powerful position to promote economic and social wellbeing in its fullest sense, for customers, for future generations, as well as for shareholders.<br><br>Professor and former Dean of the Sa�d Business School in Oxford, Mayer is a leading figure in the global discussion about the purpose and role of the corporation. In <em>Prosperity</em>, he presents a radical and carefully considered agenda for corporations themselves, and for the regulatory frameworks that will enable them to do this. Drawing together insights from business, law, and economics, science, philosophy, and history, he shows how the corporation can realize its full potential to contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of the many, not just the few. <br><br><em>Prosperity</em> is as much a discussion of how to create and run successful businesses as it is a guide to policymaking to fix the broken system.<br></p><p><br><strong>Colin Mayer </strong>is the Peter Moores Professor of Management Studies at the Said Business School at the University of Oxford. He is a Professorial Fellow and Sub-Warden of Wadham College, Oxford and an Honorary Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford and St Anne's College, Oxford. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to business education and the administration of justice in the economic sphere in the 2017 New Years Honours. Colin Mayer was the first professor at the Said Business School, and the first Director of the Oxford Financial Research Centre. He was also previously the Peter Moores Dean of the Business School. He was a Harkness Fellow at Harvard University, a Houblon-Norman Fellow at the Bank of England, the first Leo Goldschmidt Visiting Professor of Corporate Governance at the Solvay Business School, Universite de Bruxelles, and has had visiting positions at Columbia, MIT, and Stanford universities.<br><br>"Mayer of the Sa�d Business School at Oxford is one of the world's foremost critics of the idea that the aim of companies is to maximise shareholder value. This, he argues cogently, represents a betrayal of one of humanity's most extraordinary inventions." --Martin Wolf, Books of the Year 2018, <em>The</em> <em>Financial Times</em><p></p><br>"[A] remarkable and radical new book." --Martin Wolf, <em>The Financial Times</em><p></p><br>"Mayer's manifesto recasts the company's place in society." --Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, <em>The Financial Times</em><p></p><br>"This is a timely and highly insightful treatise on the urgent need to revisit today's misguided and simplistic views on the purpose of the corporation. It is a significant contribution addressing the growing economic and social challenges confronting us today." -- Cyrus Ardelan, Chairman, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd<p></p><br>"Here is the case for reinventing the corporation so that it serves human well-being. Colin Mayer shows both why an exclusive focus on shareholder value is damaging, and how purposeful changes could support trustworthy corporations that combine social and business benefits." --Baroness Onora O'Neill of Bengarve, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, University of Cambridge<p></p><br>"A powerful reply to the steadily increasing criticism of free market business� So far, the defenders of capitalism have failed to find a convincing voice or to offer any significant ways to improve how business is perceived. Now Colin Mayer provides answers and a coherent manifesto for change." -- Peter Chadwick, IEDP Book Reviews<p></p><br>"A wonderful manifesto for change and essential reading for any who remain to be convinced that business can -- and should -- be a force for a societal good. One of the most insightful and comprehensive accounts yet of how and why the corporation needs to change if it is to meet the needs and expectations of a new era. Thoughtful and well-argued, Mayer has done the cause of enlightened capitalism great service." --Paul Polman, CEO, Unilever<p></p><br>"Businesses have a duty to do well by stakeholders as well as shareholders. How did too many corporations lose their sense of purpose? What is the right path to build responsible, sustainable relationships with society? This insight-rich book offers a comprehensive guide for restoring trust between companies, consumers, and communities. Professor Mayer makes a compelling argument that the purpose and values of modern corporations have been diluted and it will take the work of executives, legislators, regulators, bankers, investors, and even shareholders to fix." --Dominic Barton, Global Managing Partner Emeritus, McKinsey &amp; Company<p></p><br>"With characteristic courage and purposeful passion, Mayer challenges the status quo as to who corporations serve and benefit. <em>Prosperity</em> presents a paradigm shift, revealing tomorrow�s corporation today. It marks the start of a new age of enlightenment, which will stimulate the sensibilities of all who care about the role of business in society." --Guy Jubb, former Global Head of Governance and Stewardship, Standard Life Investments<p></p><br>"Our world does not have long for business to escape its 40 year-long capture by the Chicago school. This book is an historic milestone in economic theory because it marks the final nail in Milton Friedman�s intellectual coffin. It does this by illuminating a pragmatic pathway for business and policy makers to follow, to escape an anachronistic orthodoxy that is killing our beautiful planet and our precious communities. They must study it closely and then move fast, so that we all - and those who come after us - might avoid calamity and, instead, prosper." --James Perry, Chairman of Cook<p></p><br>"In his humane and readable book, Colin Mayer makes a compelling case for a new concept of the corporation, and the need to treat corporate purpose as far more than shareholder value. In showing how restoring trust is key to a true future prosperity, it will reframe much of our thinking on this central subject." --The Hon. Mr Justice William Blair, High Court Judge of England and Wales<p></p><br>"One of the most pressing questions facing the world today is 'What is the role of the corporation in society?' Thanks to Professor Colin Mayer we now have a definitive answer: the corporation's role is to fulfill its purpose. In an intellectual and very readable tour de force, Professor Mayer brings to bear an astonishing range of academic disciplines to present a very practical framework for how company's need to be managed today. For their own sake and the sake of us all." --Robert Eccles, Founding Chairman of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and Professor of Management Practice, University of Oxford<p></p><br>"The financial crisis and its aftermath called for answers; questions were raised instead. Our corporate and political environments have been severely shaken for more than a decade. We have to find new approaches and look for better answers to bring our social market economies into balance. Colin Mayer relentlessly challenges conventional wisdom, combining diverse academic fields and bringing business to meet academia. <em>Prosperity</em> is building on a wealth of research looking at the broader picture and its many corners to seek appropriate answers to the challenges of our world. Is 'purpose first, prosperity follows' the answer?" --Daniela Weber-Rey, non-executive director of HSBC Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt and Fnac-Darty<p></p><br>"Rarely in the history of economics and law does a person observe the current state of the world, recognize its deficiencies, and put forth a policy and paradigm that is destined to change the world. John Maynard Keynes in the twenties and thirties and now Colin Mayer are prime examples. This book is destined to be the 'bible' of the <em>Mayer-Paradigm</em> of corporate governance and the template for the policy changes that are necessary to implement it." --Martin Lipton, Senior Partner Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz<p></p><br>"Colin Mayer has elevated the conversation about business and society. Bold enough to reimagine an economic system, specific enough to drive action, <em>Prosperity</em> introduces the higher-order thinking necessary to build a more Inclusive Capitalism." --Lynn Forester de Rothschild, CEO of E.L. Rothschild and the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism<p></p><br>"<em>Prosperity</em> makes a limpidly clear and convincing case for an urgent re-think of the role of business in society. The fifty years since Friedman gave the doctrine of 'shareholder value' totemic significance have seen the interests of proprietors, governments and communities diverge. This has produced unacceptable inequalities in outcomes and shocking destruction of the environment. The arguments Colin makes for radical reform of the role of the corporation in society are compelling, and rooted in common sense and fairness. I hope that many others involved in defining the purpose of their businesses learn as much from <em>Prosperity</em> as I have." --Peter Norris, Chairman of Virgin Group<p></p><br>"[Colin Mayer's] book is a resounding paean and radical road map towards a bright future for the corporation and capitalism." -- The Financial Times.<p></p><br></p><h2>Workbook to Accompany Entre Mundos: An Integrated Approach for th Native Speaker, 2nd Edition</h2><p>The workbook will provide a systematic tool for students to further practice writing, particularly those items that are problematic for heritage speakers.</p><p></p><h2>Martini&#39;s Atlas of the Human Body</h2><p><p>The Atlas offers an abundant collection of anatomy photographs, radiology scans, and embryology summaries, helping students visualize structures and become familiar with the types of images seen in a clinical setting.

In assessing such ecological changes, Silver pays particular attention to regional variations, explaining how local geography and settlement patterns influenced the environment.

From Western Europe to Africa, many existing states are either combining into larger communities or falling apart. Many of their functions are likely to be taken over by a variety of organizations that, whatever their precise nature, are not states. In this unique volume Martin van Creveld traces the story of the state from its beginnings to its end. Starting with the simplest political organizations that ever existed, he guides the reader through the origins of the state, its development, its apotheosis during the two World Wars, and its spread from its original home in Western Europe to cover the globe. In doing so, he provides a fascinating history of government from its origins to the present day.

First, the state is regarded as "merely one of the forms" the organization of government has assumed; therefore it is not eternal.

Reid Hastie, University of Colorado at Boulder</p><h2>The Uses of Grammar</h2><p>In this second edition of THE USES OF GRAMMAR, Judith Rodby and W. Ross Winterowd develop their successful first edition with new examples, more discussion questions and exercises, and clear explanations of the grammatical principles that teach students to understand grammar conceptually and deeply. The first edition has been completely redesigned visually to enhance learning and retention. Rodby and Winterowd&#39;s THE USES OF GRAMMAR 2E is an accessible approach grounded in deep understanding of language acquisition, structure, and even the rhetoric of everyday use. THE USES OF GRAMMAR 2E integrates traditional, structural, and functional concepts with ideas from contemporary linguistics and grammatical study. Rather than simply partition the study of grammar from the bottom up-from the parts to the whole-Rodby and Winterowd employ a unique structure based on the differentiation of FORM and FUNCTION. This structure is framed around three questions: What are the forms in the grammar of American English? How do those forms function in that grammar? How are they used in real-life speaking and writing to achieve specific purposes? Students may learn, for example, how a variety of FORMS (including nouns, pronouns, verbals, and clauses) can all FUNCTION as nominals. This form/function approach ensures that students learn the uses of grammar as both an object of study and as the living text of social interaction. | THE USES OF GRAMMAR thus uses living language to illustrate the practical applications of grammar in our lives. These examples are drawn from a wide variety of sources-newspapers, magazines, books, and the writings of undergraduate students--and from such writers and speakers as Ronald Reagan, Shirley Chisholm, Groucho Marx, Mark Twain, and Jane Addams. Class-tested and refined to be student- and instructor-friendly, THE USES OF GRAMMAR 2E also features &#34;For Discussion&#34; sections that enhance students&#39; understanding of the principles covered in the text and encourage classroom discussion. &#34;Using Grammar&#34; sections show students how to think about grammar&#39;s function in social relations. &#34;Language Learning&#34; sections summarize critical concepts. Chapter Previews and Chapter Reviews help students anticipate the new principles, rules, and concepts to follow and reinforce learning. Exercises ask students to rehearse new learning, and Challengers ask them to apply this learning to broader issues or more complex problems. | JUDITH RODBY joined the faculty at California State University, Chico in 1989 after finishing her PhD in the rhetoric, linguistics, and literature program at the University of Southern California.

Kahn shows how project and system have long been at work in our theological and philosophical tradition. Against this background, Kahn explains the development of the modern legal imagination in the nineteenth century as a movement from project to system. Americans began the century imagining the constitutional order as their common project: a deliberate construction of We the People. They ended the century imagining that order is continuous with the common law: an immanent development of the principles of civilization.

But the Golden State's governance flaws reflect worrisome national trends with origins in the 1970s and 1980s. Growing voter distrust with government, a demand for services but not taxes to pay for them, a sharp decline in enlightened leadership and effective civic watchdogs, and dysfunctional political institutions have all contributed to the current governance malaise. Until recently, San Diego, California&#x2015;America's 8th largest city&#x2015;seemed immune to such systematic governance disorders. This sunny beach town entered the 1990s proclaiming to be "America's Finest City," but in a few short years its reputation went from "Futureville" to "Enron-by-the-Sea." In this eye-opening and telling narrative, Steven P. Erie, Vladimir Kogan, and Scott A. MacKenzie mix policy analysis, political theory, and history to explore and explain the unintended but largely predictable failures of governance in San Diego. Using untapped primary sources&#x2015;interviews with key decision makers and public documents&#x2015;and benchmarking San Diego with other leading California cities, <i>Paradise Plundered</i> examines critical dimensions of San Diego's governance failure: a multi-billion dollar pension deficit; a chronic budget deficit; inadequate city services and infrastructure; grandiose planning initiatives divorced from dire fiscal realities; an insulated downtown redevelopment program plagued by poorly-crafted public-private partnerships; and, for the metropolitan region, inadequate airport and port facilities, a severe underinvestment in firefighting capacity despite destructive wildfires, and heightened Mexican border security concerns. Far from a sunny story of paradise and prosperity, this account takes stock of an important but understudied city, its failed civic leadership, and poorly performing institutions, policymaking, and planning. Though the extent of these failures may place San Diego in a league of its own, other cities are experiencing similar challenges and political changes. As such, this tale of civic woe offers valuable lessons for urban scholars, practitioners, and general readers concerned about the future of their own cities.</p><p>Steven P. Erie is a Professor of Political Science and Director of the Urban Studies and Planning Program, University of California, San Diego. He is the author of <i>Rainbow's End: Irish Americans and the Dilemmas of Urban Machine Politics</i> (1998), <i>Globalizing L.A.: Trade, Infrastructure, and Regional Development</i> (Stanford, 2004), and <i>Beyond 'Chinatown': The Metropolitan Water District, Growth, and the Environment in Southern California</i> (Stanford, 2006). Vladimir Kogan is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, San Diego. Scott A. MacKenzie is Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Davis."While making some comparisons with other California cities, the book is at its best when focusing on the politics and collusions used to wring private gain out of transaction alleged to be of public benefit. This is a cautionary tale that should be read by anyone concerned with governance, economic development, and business-government relationships in American cities. . . Highly recommended." (J. L. Mikesell)<br><br>"<i>Paradise Plundered</i> chronicles San Diego's decline from one of the nation's best governed cities to its current position as poster child for inept city management. Meticulously researched and convincingly argued, [it] is a cautionary tale for any community that demands good government but is unwilling to pay for it." (Joel Rast <i>University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</i>)<br><br>"<i>Paradise Plundered</i> is a must-read for urban scholars and an invaluable resource for political science and public affairs courses, as it enriches an urban governance literature that has a place in naive, simple-opposition, pluralist, and elite explanations of urban policy. It convincingly demonstrates how pluralist forces expressed through district election and restrictive fiscal institutions interact with elite development interests in the absence of a responsible civic sector or public officials committed to broader public interests. . . The study makes an undeniable contribution to both political science scholarship and policy practice by compellingly elaborating the forces that constrain effective urban governance." (Juliet Ann Musso <i><i>Political Science Quarterly</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>Paradise Plundered</i> provides a trenchant analysis of governance and public policy in San Diego over the past two decades. The authors show how weak public institutions and persistent anti-tax sentiment created a grossly underfunded pension system, massive structural deficits, and a balkanized city. San Diego's fall from grace offers a cautionary tale that is a must read for anyone who cares about effective urban government." (Margaret Weir, University of California <i>Berkeley</i>)<br><br>"San Diego may have been the only major city in the United States (8th largest in population) lacking a significant academic book analyzing its urban politics and governance. No more. With <i>Paradise Plundered</i> we now have a well researched and reasoned volume that fills that gap . . . <i>Paradise Plundered</i>'s organization, clarity, and writing style makes it well suited not only for academics and graduate and undergraduate students, but also for practitioners and citizens interested in understanding how political power is exercised in American metropolitan areas." (Nico Calavita)<br><br>"It takes more than scenery to make a successful city&#x2015;or a solvent state, for that matter. Chronicling the near-deliberate dismantlement of San Diego, <i> Paradise Plundered</i> relates how a favored city squandered its heritage and thereby set forth a warning to the rest of the nation." (Kevin Starr <i>University of Southern California</i>)<br><br>"A landmark expose of how fiscal populism provides camouflage for private greed in America's most badly governed big city. San Diego's celebrated 'public-private partnerships' are unmasked as Ponzi schemes on the road to municipal ruin."

The phenomenon known as language death has started to accelerate as the world has grown smaller. <br><br>This extinction of languages, and the knowledge therein, has no parallel in human history. K. David Harrison's book is the first to focus on the essential question, what is lost when a language dies? What forms of knowledge are embedded in a language's structure and vocabulary? And how harmful is it to humanity that such knowledge is lost forever?<br><br>Harrison spans the globe from Siberia, to North America, to the Himalayas and elsewhere, to look at the human knowledge that is slowly being lost as the languages that express it fade from sight. He uses fascinating anecdotes and portraits of some of these languages' last remaining speakers, in order to demonstrate that this knowledge about ourselves and the world is inherently precious and once gone, will be lost forever. This knowledge is not only our cultural heritage (oral histories, poetry, stories, etc.) but very useful knowledge about plants, animals, the seasons, and other aspects of the natural world--not to mention our understanding of the capacities of the human mind. Harrison's book is a testament not only to the pressing issue of language death, but to the remarkable span of human knowledge and ingenuity. It will fascinate linguists, anthropologists, and general readers.<br></p><p><br><strong>K David Harrison</strong> is Assistant Professor of Linguistics, Swarthmore College. As a linguist and specialist in Siberian Turkic languages, he has spent many months in Siberia and Mongolia working with nomadic herders and studying their languages and traditions. He has also worked in India, Bolivia, the Philippines, Lithuania, and the United States. His work on endangered languages is featured in the documentary film <em>The Linguists</em> and was featured on the Comedy Central series <em>The Colbert Report</em>.<br><br>"At our current rate of language loss, by the end of this century the vast majority of the world's languages will be either extinct or will be spoken by only a few old people. While much effort and money are now being spent to stem the loss of plant and animal species, the human tragedy of language loss is receiving little attention. This movingly written and fascinating book tells why languages are vanishing, and what we can do to save our linguistic heritage." --Jared Diamond, Professor of Geography, University of California, Los Angeles and Pulitzer prize winning author of <em>Guns, Germs, and</em> <em>Steel</em><p></p><br>"In this scholarly yet very readable study, Harrison writes powerfully of the value and beauty of these vanishing knowledge systems." --<em>The Guardian</em><p></p><br>Rich in details yet surprisingly easy to read, When Languages Die shows what we are losing. --<em>Science Magazine</em><p></p><br>"Depending on how one counts, it is likely that hald of the world's languages will be lost over the next thirty years, a dramatic change in human history. Harrison explores dying languages, how they differ from stable languages, how they encode cultural information that is lost with them, how their speakers behave, and much more. He tells a fascinating and tragic story of immense drama." --David W. Lightfoot, National Science Foundation<p></p><br>"This important and useful book fills a valuable niche in what is now a voluminous and ever-growing collection of studies devoted to understanding reasons for and consequences of language death. Harrison's book focuses on the intellectual loss from the sum of human knowledge that such language death represents." --<em>Journal of Anthropological Research</em><p></p><br>"Harrison tackles the question of what is lost when a language dies from the vantage point of field studies with some of the few remaining speakers of endangered languages in Siberia, Mongolia, and elsewhere. <em>When Languages Die</em> reveals an astonishingly rich catalog of human intellectual heritage and scientific knowledge on the verge of disappearing as many of the world's small languages become extinct." --Suzanne Romaine, Oxford University<p></p><br>"Written in clear and concise prose, <em>When Languages Die</em> provides a captivating account of how languages encode and categorize human knowledge and experience. Harrison brings together a wealth of examples from all over the world to illustrate just how very much is lost when a language ceases to be spoken. The book is a must-read for anyone interested in people and how we think, perceive, and understand the world we live in." --Lenore A. Grenoble, Dartmouth College<p></p><br>"Depending on how one counts, it is likely that hald of the world's languages will be lost over the next thirty years, a dramatic change in human history. Harrison explores dying languages, how they differ from stable languages, how they encode cultural information that is lost with them, how their speakers behave, and much more. He tells a fascinating and tragic story of immense drama." --David W. Lightfoot, National Science Foundation<p></p><br>"An important book with a clear niche in the teaching of undergraduates and in alerting a larger reading public to the magnitude and consequences associated with current trends in linguistic extinction.

In response to this disaster the complete array of military and civilian investigative and judicial procedures ran their course. After almost two years of investigation with virtually unlimited resources, no culprit emerged, no bad guy showed himself, no smoking gun was found. This book attempts to make sense of this tragedy--a tragedy that on its surface makes no sense at all.</p><br><p> With almost twenty years in uniform and a Ph.D. in organizational behavior, Lieutenant Colonel Snook writes from a unique perspective. A victim of friendly fire himself, he develops individual, group, organizational, and cross-level accounts of the accident and applies a rigorous analysis based on behavioral science theory to account for critical links in the causal chain of events. By explaining separate pieces of the puzzle, and analyzing each at a different level, the author removes much of the mystery surrounding the shootdown. Based on a grounded theory analysis, Snook offers a dynamic, cross-level mechanism he calls "practical drift"--the slow, steady uncoupling of practice from written procedure--to complete his explanation.</p><br><p> His conclusion is disturbing. This accident happened because, or perhaps in spite of everyone behaving just the way we would expect them to behave, just the way theory would predict.

This third edition is backed by substantial research that supports the idea that Sport Education is a valuable and motivating approach to delivering quality physical education experiences for students from the early elementary grades through the university years.<br><br><b>New and Revised Material</b><br><i>Complete Guide to Sport Education, Third Edition, </i>offers readers a significant amount of revised and new material, including enhanced guidance for Sport Education programming across a year. Also noteworthy is the updated alignment of Sport Education&#x2019;s goals and objectives with the SHAPE America standards and the national learning objectives from other countries.<br><br> In addition, the text provides six brand-new chapters on the following topics: <ul><li>Including students with special needs</li><li>Implementing Sport Education beyond physical education (e.g., school-based after-school programs, intramurals, community-based programs, and university basic instruction programs)</li><li>Evidence-based research on Sport Education</li><li>Developing effective program-level policies and procedures</li><li>Managing equipment, facilities, and supplies</li><li>Sport Education&#x2019;s link with international objectives</li></ul><b>Unique Approach to Sport Education</b><br><i>Complete Guide to Sport Education</i> represents a departure from traditional curriculum and instruction (C&amp;I) models because it takes an effective student-centered approach, providing students with opportunities to take ownership and responsibility for various aspects of their class experiences. This approach better prepares students to be lifelong participants in healthy physical activity and sport&#x2014;and to be more engaged in class.<br><br> The text targets more in-depth and authentic learning experiences than most C&amp;I models, giving students time to develop the skills they need and to learn to fulfill the team roles required for successful seasons. This latest edition introduces new readers to the idea of Sport Education and gives previous users of the model some fresh ways to expand their seasons and make them even more engaging and attractive to their students. Through Sport Education, students are shown effective and meaningful ways to learn about sport, to take part in sport, and to view sport as something they can connect with and find meaning in.<br><br><b>Updated Ancillaries</b><br><i>Complete Guide to Sport Education</i> comes with several useful and updated ancillaries: <ul><li>A <b>web resource</b> that provides a wealth of examples to support the book content; this resource includes forms, charts, assessments, and other tools</li><li>A <b>test package</b> that houses 447 multiple-choice and short-answer questions</li><li>A <b>presentation package</b> with 225 slides outlining the book&#x2019;s content, including select tables and illustrations from the book</li><li>An <b>instructor guide</b> that includes course syllabus templates for instructors of undergraduate and graduate students, and provides core course assignments, optional course assignments, graduate student course assignments, and signature assignments</li></ul><b>Book Organization</b><br> The text is organized into three parts, with <b>part I</b> outlining the essential features of the Sport Education model and identifying the key aspects upon which the model is based. The importance of sport as a cultural phenomenon is then introduced to explain why it should be a part of school physical education programs. This part also addresses how to identify and select season outcomes, how to use instructional alignment to gain quality season experiences, and how to promote physical activity beyond physical education.<br><br><b>Part II </b>explores all the important considerations in designing and implementing Sport Education seasons. This includes modifying games and activities, designing competition formats, selecting teams and roles, teaching fair play, developing competent players, and more.<br><br><b>Part III </b>delves into key program design considerations, showing the links between Sport Education and U.S. content standards as well as learning objectives from a number of other countries, guiding readers through the assessment process, and examining the various aspects involved in managing a physical education program based on Sport Education.

But the greatest benefit is the enduring quality of an evidence-based, student-centered text that has proven to be of high value to instructors and students alike. Through the book&#x2019;s Sport Education model, students develop sport skills, grow in leadership and responsibility, and learn about the nonplaying roles of the sport experience (e.g., coach, trainer, publicist, equipment manager, choreographer). All of this leads to being more engaged in class&#x2014;and to continuing a healthy physical activity engagement beyond the school years.</p><p><b>Daryl Siedentop, PED,</b> is a professor emeritus at The Ohio State University.

Instead, Yanni Loukissas argues in <i>All Data Are Local</i>, we should approach data sets with an awareness that data are created by humans and their dutiful machines, at a time, in a place, with the instruments at hand, for audiences that are conditioned to receive them. The term <i>data set</i> implies something discrete, complete, and portable, but it is none of those things. Examining a series of data sources important for understanding the state of public life in the United States&#x2015;Harvard's Arnold Arboretum, the Digital Public Library of America, UCLA's Television News Archive, and the real estate marketplace Zillow&#x2015;Loukissas shows us how to analyze data settings rather than data sets.</p><p>Loukissas sets out six principles: all data are local; data have complex attachments to place; data are collected from heterogeneous sources; data and algorithms are inextricably entangled; interfaces recontextualize data; and data are indexes to local knowledge. He then provides a set of practical guidelines to follow. To make his argument, Loukissas employs a combination of qualitative research on data cultures and exploratory data visualizations.

This collection of stories from Angela's classroom highlights the problem-solving potential of very young students. Arranged by month of the school year, each of these ten stories is an inspiration for a classroom lesson. Together the stories provide a comprehensive picture of what can be accomplished with little kids: making sense of math is the focus of the teaching; respecting children's thinking makes it possible. </p><p>Several major themes recur throughout the stories: </p><li><b>the distinction between academic and intellectual goals</b>-the intellectual dispositions in action in this classroom reveal how children can make sense of experience and observations, how they can estimate, predict, hypothesize, analyze, and apply mathematical concepts in practical and visible ways.<br> </li><li><b>the real meaning of a "community of learners"</b>-how children can help, occasionally hinder, but ultimately challenge each other.<br> </li><li><b>perseverance</b>-the ability of even very young children to persist until they have resolved problems. To see the deep satisfaction kindergartners gain from hard work, or what they call "hard fun," is what makes Angela's day-to-day life in the classroom so wonderful and rewarding.<br> </li><li><b>accountability</b>-how teachers can satisfy NCTM principles and standards in math while addressing children's needs and capabilities.<p></p> <p>With every story, Angela provides not only a narrative, but also a thoughtful appraisal of her own decisions, dilemmas, and choices in the teaching of math. At the end of each story, Paul Trafton focuses on the math involved and the mathematical reasoning of the children. Clearly evident throughout is the authors' conviction that teachers not only need to understand the math in the problems the children are tackling, but also to listen respectfully and to question them honestly about their thinking. In this way, teachers can support their young students and capitalize on the opportunities at hand, the many "teachable moments" this book so successfully captures.</p></li></p><p><p>Angela Andrews has spent more than 25 years teaching preschool and kindergarten.

Where once fashion was seen as marginal, it has now entered into core economic discourse focused around ideas about &#x2018;cultural&#x2019; and &#x2018;creative&#x2019; work as a major driver of developed economies. With a new preface and new material on the evolving fashion industry, this second edition gives a clear summary of the theories surrounding the role and function of fashion in modern society. Entwistle examines how fashion plays a crucial role in the formation of modern identity through its articulation of the body, gender and sexuality.<br><br>The book offers a much needed synthesis between the literature on fashion and dress, and the sociology of the body, offering an updated critique of the issues raised in the first edition. Entwistle shows how an understanding of fashion and dress requires an understanding of the meanings acquired by the body in culture since it is the body that fashion speaks to and which is dressed in almost all social situations and encounters. She argues that while fashion refers to a specific system of dress originating in the west, all cultures &#x2018;dress&#x2019; the body in the same way, making it a crucial feature of social order. Drawing on the work of theorists, the book offers insights into the connections that need to be made between the body, fashion and dress.<br><br><i>The Fashioned Body</i> will be an invaluable resource for anyone interested in the social role of fashion and dress in modern culture.</p></p><p>Jo Entwistle is Senior Lecturer in Culture, Media and Creative Industries at King&#x2019;s College London.<i>"The Fashioned Body</i> is a landmark text without which we might still be exploring the sartorial as pure expression of the zeitgeist, never considering fashion wearers. Instead, in this beautifully written account, fashion emerges as a negotiation between designers and wearers in which the physical body is central. Updated and with new substantive sections on space and urban geography and the &#x2018;aesthetic economy&#x2019;, this second edition charts the rise of fashion from peculiarity of Western modernity to its centrality in contemporary global cultural economies. It explores fashion&#x2019;s gendered investments in debates about both &#x2018;pornification&#x2019; and modesty and crucially frames fashion as &#x2018;situated bodily practice&#x2019;."<br> <b>Ruth Holliday, University of Leeds</b><br> <br> "This is a timely and much-awaited new edition of The Fashioned Body, a path-breaking book that conjoined fashion, dress and the body in new and exciting ways. The new edition clearly demonstrates the value of drawing together complex, interdisciplinary literatures to explore and expose the making and shaping of fashion markets. The new emphasis on the ways in which clothing is always embodied, contingent and context specific adds considerably to our understanding of fashion practice. Entwistle weaves together a powerful narrative of how magic and meaning, design and desire are conjoined with market mechanisms and regulatory regimes to produce fashion. By addressing the complex and interwoven amalgam of production, consumption, creativity and constraint, Entwistle reveals the alchemy that is contemporary fashion. A must-read for anyone interested in the making and shaping of fashioned bodies." <br> <b>Louise Crewe, University of Nottingham</b></p><h2>Introduction to Deep Learning (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>A project-based guide to the basics of deep learning.</b></p><p>This concise, project-driven guide to deep learning takes readers through a series of program-writing tasks that introduce them to the use of deep learning in such areas of artificial intelligence as computer vision, natural-language processing, and reinforcement learning. The author, a longtime artificial intelligence researcher specializing in natural-language processing, covers feed-forward neural nets, convolutional neural nets, word embeddings, recurrent neural nets, sequence-to-sequence learning, deep reinforcement learning, unsupervised models, and other fundamental concepts and techniques.

It argues that photography originates in what is seen, rather than in the human eye or the camera lens, and that it is the world's primary way of revealing itself to us. Neither an index, representation, nor copy, as conventional studies would have it, the photographic image is an analogy. This principle obtains at every level of its being: a photograph analogizes its referent, the negative from which it is generated, every other print that is struck from that negative, and all of its digital "offspring." </p> <p>Photography is also unstoppably developmental, both at the level of the individual image and of medium. The photograph moves through time, in search of other "kin," some of which may be visual, but others of which may be literary, architectural, philosophical, or literary. Finally, photography develops with us, and in response to us. It assumes historically legible forms, but when we divest them of their saving power, as we always seem to do, it goes elsewhere.</p> <p>The present volume focuses on the nineteenth century and some of its contemporary progeny. It begins with the camera obscura, which morphed into chemical photography and lives on in digital form, and ends with Walter Benjamin. Key figures discussed along the way include Nic�phore Ni�pce, Louis Daguerre, William Fox-Talbot, Jeff Wall, and Joan Fontcuberta.</p></p><p>Kaja Silverman is Keith L. and Katherine Sachs Professor of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the author, most recently, of <i>Flesh of My Flesh</i> (SUP, 2009)."Not simply a new counter-history, <i>The Miracle of Analogy</i> marks a paradigm shift after which photography will never again be thought of in the same way. Kaja Silverman's book sets the stage for future debates about the range of photography studies." (Natalia Brizuela, University of California <i>Berkeley</i>)<br><br>"This is a lovely, intriguing book, powerfully argued, compellingly illustrated&#x2015;a major provocation. Challenging all the ways we're so used to thinking about photography, its richly textured counter-history invites us to rethink the very meaning of the 'analogue' in the contemporary digital age." (Rebecca Comay <i>University of Toronto</i>)<br><br>"[T]his is not the usual chronology of great photographers or sample case studies, but a genuine attempt to contribute towards an intellectual history of the medium....Silverman takes the orthodoxies of photographic theory and its history and shakes them up together." (David Bate <i><i>Source: The Photographic Review</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>The Miracle of Analogy</i> is a must-read. Driven by careful study of various practitioners while masterfully juggling historical analysis with theoretical insight, Silverman unearths a missed opportunity in understanding what photography was, is, and will be."

The central ideas of this carefully researched volume are important and original." (George Lzroiu <i><i>Review of Contemporary Philosophy</i></i>)<br><br>"A masterly account of how photography strengthens the binds that connect us with others and the world, this book argues that each picture holds within the instant of its making an opportunity to see anew the dense and entangled relationships that ground our understanding of what it means to be <i>here</i>."

After earning a master's degree in school psychology, he worked as a child psychologist at the University of Kansas Medical Center. He received his Ed.D. from the University of Kansas in 1969 and took a position with the Department of Special Education and Rehabilitation Counseling at the University of Kentucky, where he currently is a full professor and coordinates the graduate Personnel Preparation Program for Teachers of Students with Emotional and Behavioral Disabilities. Dr. Nelson has authored or edited over 100 professional publications, including books, textbook chapters, articles in referred journals, and multimedia instructional packages. He has prepared teachers of children and youth with behavior disorders at the pre- and in-service levels and has served as principal investigator on a number of research and personnel preparation grants. He has served as president of the Council for Children with Behavioral Disorders. Currently, he is involved in two national centers that promote research and best practices for students with or at risk for emotional and behavioral disorders: the Center for Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support, and the Center for Education, Disability, and Juvenile Justice. He also is associated with the Kentucky Center for School Safety. </p><p> In our preface to the third edition of this text, we observed that public and professional concerns about students with challenging behavior had increased alarmingly. Fueled by press coverage of recent acts of school violence, this trend has accelerated. America's schools are facing a crisis with regard to finding more effective ways to deal with students who exhibit challenging behavior, including those who bring weapons to school, assault other students and teachers, exhibit defiant and disruptive behaviors, and commit acts of vandalism. The strategies traditionally used to address such problems, including punishment and school exclusion, have not been effective. Policies of "zero tolerance" for misbehavior have resulted in large numbers of students, even preschoolers, being suspended and expelled, or placed in alternative programs, often without services to address their complex behavioral and emotional needs. </p> <p> At the same time, national reports continue to indicate that special education programs for the segment of the school population identified as having emotional disturbance (ED) or emotional and behavioral disabilities (EBD) have not been effective. These students include children and youth with internalizing disorders (social withdrawal, psychological problems, and psychiatric disorders) in addition to those with externalizing disorders such as those mentioned above. This student population remains chronically underidentified and underserved in the public schools, and identified students are educated in the most restrictive settings and experience the lowest rates of planned inclusion. Status and outcome reports document poor academic achievement, high rates of grade retention, the lowest rate of high school graduation of any group of students with disabilities, and extremely poor post-school adjustment. </p> <p> These issues continue to prevail in spite of the articulation of national educational policies and goals that focus more than ever on recognizing and addressing the mental health needs of children (i.e., Education 2000). Educational reform has been a major agenda in many states. Unfortunately, with regard to student behavior, most reform efforts continue to emphasize harsh and reactive punishment, applied piecemeal and too late. Excluding students with undesired behavior from schools only transfers the problem to other child-serving agencies, such as those in the fields of mental health, child welfare, and juvenile justice. These systems likewise are being overwhelmed by the sheer number of children needing services, as well as by their own set of poor outcomes (e.g., high rates of psychiatric hospitalization, out-of-home placement, and incarceration). Moreover, the cost of treatment in these systems is enormously more expensive than public education (e.g., between $35,000 and $60,000 a year to incarcerate one juvenile), and these expenses are borne by taxpayers, not the youths' parents. Professionals in all of these disciplines are recognizing that EBD is a severe disability that often cannot be adequately addressed within a single system or in one location. Accordingly, in many parts of the country, system-of-care initiatives have been developed to provide comprehensive and coordinated services to these children and their families in their local communities. Evaluation reports indicate that it is possible to meet the diverse and complex needs of these children and their families without resorting to expensive programs that remove the child and attempt to treat him or her out of the context of the natural environment. However, even within these systems of care, services often are applied well after the child's and family's needs have reached crisis proportions. </p> <p> Fortunately, the initiatives directed toward student behavior that we cited in the third edition have continued to evolve and have been augmented by more recent advances. A national movement to improve school safety through positive and proactive measures has been gaining momentum through the creation of state and national centers for school safety and publication of strategic documents such as <i>Early Warning, Timely Response: A Guide to Safe Schools</i> (Dwyer, Osher, &amp; Warger, 1998) and <i>Safeguarding Our Children: An Action Guide</i> (Dwyer &amp; Osher, 2000). The 1997 amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) include, for the first time, requirements that schools conduct functional behavioral assessments of students with disabilities whose challenging behavior causes staff to consider a change in placement, including alternative placement, suspension, or exclusion. These assessments provide the basis for proactive behavior intervention plans. Changes also are taking place in the way behavior intervention plans are formed and implemented. Indicative of a shift in attitude and approach to dealing with challenging student behavior is the recent practice of referring to intervention plans as behavior support plans. This approach, referred to as positive behavior support, began in research involving individuals with developmental disabilities who exhibit challenging behavior. Its focus is on teaching students new, appropriate skills that are more effective than their old, undesired behaviors in achieving such desired outcomes as gaining attention and escaping or avoiding undesired events. Recently, this research has been extended to students with little or no cognitive impairment. The result is a growing intervention technology that employs information gathered from functional behavior assessments to build interventions that teach and support adaptive behaviors rather than simply responding to maladaptive or undesired behaviors with aversive stimuli. </p> <p> The philosophy and practice of positive behavior support has been extended to school-wide planning as well. School-wide discipline systems that are based on establishing clear sets of behavioral expectations, teaching these expectations to students, and rewarding them for their success, have begun to replace old systems based exclusively on punishment. Evaluations of these positive approaches to school discipline provide convincing evidence of their impact on school climate and student behavior. Moreover, behavioral researchers have articulated tiered models of positive behavior support, based on the concept of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. These models serve as guides to practitioners in making decisions regarding when, and to whom, to apply more intensive levels of intervention. Thus, primary prevention attempts to prevent initial occurrences of a problem (e.g., challenging student behavior) through universal interventions apply to all students. School-wide discipline is an example of universal intervention. Secondary prevention addresses students who are at risk for developing chronic patterns of disruptive or dangerous behavior or emotional disorders. It is applied through targeted interventions�systematic strategies that are individualized or used with small groups. Tertiary interventions address students who exhibit chronic patterns of behavior or conditions such as EBD. These intensive interventions may involve alternative placement or multiagency planning and implementation. </p> <p> By tracking students' responses to each level of intervention, educators can determine when more intensive interventions are needed for which students. Monitoring student response to each level of intervention thus serves as a convenient screening tool: Students who do not benefit from universal interventions are candidates for secondary prevention activities, and those who fail to succeed when targeted interventions are applied may be in need of tertiary prevention strategies. The theme of positive behavior support runs across all three levels, in that the major focus of intervention is on teaching the student appropriate skills that will meet his or her needs more effectively than do the problem behaviors. </p> <p> Another set of advances involves the use of technology in providing training and support for professionals who serve students with challenging behavior. Dozens of World Wide Web sites provide information and access to resources with regard to effective academic instruction, assessments and interventions for undesired student behavior, and improving school safety. Interactive, multimedia training modules (even entire courses) are available in CD-ROM and Web-based formats. These innovations, in addition to distance education courses, are increasing professionals' access to training in effective practices for students with challenging behavior. Thanks to online linkages, professionals now have greater access to another important resource�each other. Collaborative approaches to intervention planning and implementation, including wraparound planning and collaborative teaching in general education classrooms, also have improved the support base for persons who work with the full range of student behavior, from strategies that prevent or minimize initial occurrences of problem behaviors to intensive interventions for some of the most challenging pupils. As educators have become more involved in transdisciplinary systems of care for this population, their collaboration with other providers and with families has increased, which has resulted in improved support for both the student and the classroom teacher. </p> <p> Finally, attention is being directed to the critical need to deliver more effective academic instruction to students with EBD. Researchers have documented the lack of effective instructional practices with this student population, and leaders in the field are calling for a focus on improving the appropriateness of curriculum and students' rates of correct academic responding. This emphasis fits well with the inclusion of direct instruction and reinforcement of appropriate social skills to replace undesired behaviors targeted for reduction in behavior support plans. </p> <p><b>NEW IN THIS EDITION</b></p> <p> The fourth edition of <i>Strategies for Addressing Behavior Problems in the Classroom</i> addresses school-based intervent...</p></p><h2>Laboratory Safety for Chemistry Students</h2><p>Provides knowledge and models of good practice needed by students to work safely in the laboratory as they progress through four years of undergraduate laboratory work&nbsp;<br> <ul> <li>Aligns with the revised safety instruction requirements from the ACS Committee on Professional Training 2015 &#x201c;Guidelines and Evaluation Procedures for Bachelor&#x2019;s Degree Programs&#x201d;</li> <li>Provides a systematic approach to incorporating safety and health into the chemistry curriculum</li> <li>Topics are divided into layers of progressively more advanced and appropriate safety issues so that some topics are covered 2-3 times, at increasing levels of depth</li> <li>Develops a strong safety ethic by continuous reinforcement of safety; to recognize, assess, and manage laboratory hazards; and to plan for response to laboratory emergencies</li> <li>Covers a thorough exposure to chemical health and safety so that students will have the proper education and training when they enter the workforce or graduate school</li> </ul></p><p><p><b>A unique approach to keeping you safe in the lab throughout your undergraduate education and</b> <b>beyond</b></p> <p><i>Laboratory Safety for Chemistry Students</i> is unlike any other college textbook you've ever seen.

However, the true definition of professionalism is not an easy one, and it is not necessarily black and white. In fact, it could be argued that it is often easier to describe what is not professional versus what is professional. It could also be disputed that although professionalism can be recognized when you see it, you may not necessarily be able to put your finger on what &#x201c;it&#x201d; is exactly.<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Professionalism Across Occupational Therapy Practice</i></b> by Dr. Elizabeth D. DeIuliis provides an overview of the wide-ranging knowledge, skills, and attitudes that encompass professionalism across the occupational therapy profession. While there is no formal endorsed definition of professionalism in occupational therapy practice, suggestions are provided to serve as a blueprint for use.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>&#x201c;Professionalism in occupational therapy practice is a dynamic sophistication, exemplified by a combination of an individual&#x2019;s personal skill set, knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes, and the adoption of the moral and ethical values of the profession and society.&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Dr. DeIuliis illustrates the concept of professionalism as a unique combination of intrinsic and extrinsic qualities surrounding key constructs of ethics, responsibility, competency and behavior. <b><i>Professionalism Across Occupational Therapy Practice</i></b> discusses these various expectations in the academic setting, the clinic, workplace, and in general society.<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Professionalism Across Occupational Therapy Practice</i></b> utilizes a developmental approach to teaching and learning, paralleling the <i>Revised Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy</i> (2001).

That album, released in 1966, fifty years ago, changed the face of popular music.<br>From conception and composition to arrangement and production,&nbsp;<i>Pet Sounds&nbsp;</i>was the work of one extraordinary man. Turning his back on the protest songs and folk rock of his contemporaries and even on the bright surf sound of his own creation, Brian Wilson reached deep within himself to make music that struck an emotional chord and touched people's souls. Embracing the rapidly advancing recording technology of the time, he expertly created an original studio sound that would inspire generations of listeners and musicians.<br>Featuring a detailed track-by-track analysis of the songs and extensive interviews with key personalities, <i>Wouldn't It Be Nice</i> reveals the influences--musical, personal, and professional--that together created this groundbreaking album. Now revised to include new information and recent developments, this is the definitive book on one of the greatest albums ever made.</p><p><b>Charles L. Granata</b>&nbsp;is a record and radio producer, music historian, and author of the award-winning&nbsp;<i>Sessions with Sinatra&nbsp;</i>as well as numerous essays on popular music and the history of sound recording. He divides his time between Los Angeles and Livingston, New Jersey.&nbsp;<b>Tony Asher</b>&nbsp;is a lyricist who collaborated with Brian Wilson on&nbsp;<i>Pet Sounds</i>. He lives in Los Angeles.In 1965, Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys released a revolutionary rock album that would influence the Beatles' Rubber Soul as well as the music of the Who, Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones. As music historian Granata points out in this often passionate, sometimes pedantic history of Pet Sounds, U.S. audiences turned a cold shoulder to this album because it represented such a departure from the pleasing surf melodies that had made the Beach Boys famous. In spite of such a reception, the album showcases the soaring musical genius of Wilson, argues Granata, in what was perhaps truly the first ever "concept album." The innovative combination of folk, blues and jazz blended into the gorgeous harmonies of the Beach Boys. Granata traces the evolution of the album from its writing, mostly by Wilson and Tony Asher, to the long nights of production in the studio. He analyzes dispassionately each song on the album, from the jangly 12-string guitar chords of "Wouldn't It Be Nice?," which open the album, to the closing harmonies of "Caroline, No" that close it. Granata chronicles Wilson's well-known disappearance from the musical scene not long after the album's release to battle the demons of paranoid schizophrenia, as well as his recent solo appearances performing the songs from Pet Sounds. Granata devotedly tells a story whose contours are already well known, so the book at times appears to be a set of liner notes allowed to grow too large. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Boundless Healing: Meditation Exercises to Enlighten the Mind and Heal the Body</h2><p>This book offers simple meditation techniques to awaken healing energies in the body and mind. Using Buddhist principles as a basis, Tulku Thondup has created a universal guide that anyone can use. It will benefit those who want to preserve good health as well as those who need comfort and relief from illness or mental distress. <i>Boundless Healing </i>offers: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Ways to employ the four healing powers: positive images, positive words, positive feelings, and positive belief <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Detailed healing exercises that can be done individually or as part of a twelve-stage program <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Exercises for dispelling anxiety <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Healing prayers for the dying and the deceased, plus advice for helpers and survivors<br>These meditations draw on our innate capacity for imagination and memory, our natural enjoyment of beauty, and our deep-seated longing for a state of quiet calm. For all those who wish to become healthier, happier, and more peaceful in everyday life.</p><p>Esteemed author and teacher Tulka Thondup offers this convincing guidebook on healing the mind, body, and spirit through meditation. Although Thondup relies on the principles of Buddhism to explain the intimate connection between the mind and body, readers won't feel pressured to become budding Buddhists in order to learn these meditation techniques. In fact, what makes <i>Boundless Healing</i> so effective is Thondup's very detailed and nondogmatic style of teaching meditations. For example, when speaking to a meditation for healing sick cells, he stays focused on the physical and mental sensations, rather than flittering into ungrounded spiritual metaphors: "As your breath is moving through your body, think and feel that all the cells of your body are also breathing. All the trillions of cells of light and blissful heat are breathing from the top of your head to the soles of your feet."<p> Devout Buddhists will find nourishing soul food in his one section devoted to specific Buddhist healing meditations. As for everyone else, Thondup has written an accessible, information-packed book that covers it all--from "Avoiding Expectations" to "Creating a Healing Aura While Sleeping" to "Meditations for the Dead or Dying" to "How Helpers and Survivors Should Behave." Regardless of the disease, discomfort, or desire, Thondup has a meditation up his sleeve, making this one of the most practical handbooks on healing meditations available. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Tulku Thondup Rinpoche was born in East Tibet and was recognized to be a tulku at age five. He studied at Tibet&#x2019;s famed Dodrupchen Monastery, settling in India in 1958 and teaching for many years in its universities. He came to the United States in 1980 as a visiting scholar at Harvard University.&nbsp; For the past three decades he has lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he writes, translates, and teaches under the auspices of the Buddhayana Foundation.

Typical of Wayne Koestenbaum&#x2019;s invigoratingly inventive style, the two books one fiction, one nonfiction run concurrently, in twin columns, and the articles a,&#x201d; an,&#x201d; and the&#x201d; never appear. The nonfiction ruminations on hotels are divided into eight dossiers, composed of short takes on the presence of hotels in the author&#x2019;s dreams as well as in literature, film, and history. Guest stars include everyone from Oscar Wilde to Marilyn Monroe. <i>Hotel Theory</i> gives (divided) voice to an aesthetic of hyperaesthesia, of yearning. It is an oblique manifesto, the place where writing disappears. A new mode of theorizing in fiction, in fragment, through quotation and palimpsest arises in this dazzling work.</p><p></p><h2>Christianity is an African Religion: How African Spirituality Gave Birth to the Light of the World. Deconstructing White Christian Religious Racism ... African Origin of Western Religious Racism</h2><p>This book affirms that Christianity was based on Black Egyptian African Spirituality. This fact has been obscured, hidden and ignored by the impact of White Christian Religious Racism. Prior to the development of modern racism, with the beginning of the Transatlantic Slave Trade and its Rapetalistic Ideology of Racial, Sexual and Economic Oppression, it was widely accepted that African Spirituality was the basis for the major theological and ethical perspectives found in the Western religions of Christianity, Judaism and Islam. Due to Institutional Racism these facts have been withheld or misrepresented by our educational institutions. This miseducation serves to support racist ideas of Black Inferiority and White Supremacy that are used to oppress Americans of African descent. Black Egyptian Africans were the original recipients and developers of the revelations of theological and ethical concepts that defined the Western Religious Traditions. Concepts such as: Monotheism, Moral Codes, Eternal Life, Resurrection, A Dying and Rising Savior, Power of the Divine Feminine, and Scripture are just a few of the fundamental truths that these ancient Black African priests and scribes gave to the world which were then used to develop Western Religions. The book is based on an article written by Dr. Donald H. Matthews in the Journal of the American Academy of Religion (JAAR), the official professional journal of the American Academy of Religion. This book It is written in a style that makes it accessible to the general public. The afore mentioned article is reprinted for the benefit of the scholarly community and for those who wish to delve further into the subject.</p><p>Dr. Donald H. Matthews, Ph. D. is a noted scholar of African American Religion and Culture.

Not once, but twice, pointing automatic weapons at the family. <b>Historic, costly blunders for the FBI. </b></p><p>In response Paine assembled his journalism crew of former feds, launched True Pundit and literally dismantled the FBI in less than two years with pens and laptops while working from home, often in pajamas. </p><p>While the mainstream media ignored a corrupt FBI &amp; DOJ, Paine and cohorts hammered away and knocked the FBI off its trusted public mantle. <b>Revered FBI leaders were fired. Others quit. FBI officials, targeted by True Pundit's hard-hitting reporting, are now targets of numerous federal investigations. A fitting irony after the FBI -- whom Paine worked for -- came into his home with M4 rifles drawn on his young kids and wife. </b>Twice. Then, the FBI went on a rampage to ruin his Fortune 100 career at Citi and even prevented him from attending his mother's funeral. </p><p>What did Paine know that terrified the Deep State and prompted FBI agents to stoop so low as to literally terrorize an 8-year-old and 12-year-old? And Paine's wife? Paine tells it all here -- revealing he was investigating Intel that the FBI, CIA &amp; White House were covering up evidence that Osama bin Laden was living and running al-Qaeda from Iran after 9/11. Paine reveals his True Identity: Loeb Award-winning &amp; Pulitzer nominated newspaper reporter and Intel expert Mike Moore. </p><p>And his insider revelations about bin Laden -- and the Bush and Obama White Houses -- are not pretty as they blow the roof off one of the most sinister, gut-wrenching scandals in U.S. history, involving Democrats and Republicans. </p><p>Implicated too here are U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller along with former CIA Director John Brennan, among many others. A Criminal conspiracy involving top players in the Deep State, entrenched in one of the greatest public betrayals imaginable. </p><p>They tried to silence Paine and ruin him to keep these alarming revelations secret but something went wrong. Paine rose from the ashes of his battered life and tattered financial career and then re-launched his award-winning journalism career. And this time -- playing by his own rules -- Paine blows the lid off of a massive cover-up that implicates the same D.C. elite who tried to take him down. </p><p>Mike "Thomas Paine" Moore's story is one of personal loss, struggle, payback and patriotism. </p><p>You may have heard the prophetic warning that <i>"One Day You're Going to Mess with the Wrong Guy." </i></p><p>In 'How We Dismantled the FBI in Our Pajamas,' Paine proves he is <b>THAT</b> guy. And the FBI -- or what's left of it now -- surely regrets the days it threatened Paine's wife and children at gunpoint, miscalculations that ultimately rocked its foundations unlike any FBI scandal in American history.<br></p></p><p>Mike &#34;Thomas Paine&#34; Moore today serves as True Pundit&#39;s chief Muckraker.

Lawrence, also known as *Lawrence of Arabia,* wrote&nbsp;<i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom: A Triumph</i> from his memories of&nbsp;serving as a liaison officer with rebel forces during the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Turks&nbsp;(1916-1918).&nbsp;Possessed of a brilliant military mind and an unmatched knowledge of the region and the Arab people, Lawrence led the revolt alongside the charismatic Faisal I, sounding the death knell for the Ottoman Empire and paving the way for a new colonial power in the region: the British. Writing from memory after his original manuscript and detailed notes were lost, Lawrence was able to privately publish a polished version of his autobiograhpical account in 1922. It is&nbsp;from this&nbsp;edition that he created the abridged version in 1927 which would become a best-seller, titling it <i>Revolt in the Desert.</i> This important historic work vividly portrays one of the most turbulent periods in the history of the Middle East while offering&nbsp;rich insight into one of Britain's&nbsp;esteemed national heroes.</p><p>The great Lawrence of Arabia&#39;s work in a high-quality abridged edition of the classic.<b>T.E.&nbsp;Lawrence</b> (1888-1935) was educated at Oxford, and later made a research fellow of All Souls College.

Armies both astral and physical are massing for and against the goddess Alshandra, who seeks to prevent the birth of one fate-bound child. It falls to the dweomermaster Jill and her allies to protect the child's human mother, Princess Carra--and Deverry's already foretold future--by magic and by might. But as the warrior Rhodry wings toward the battle on dragonback, he cannot know that soon he will face his ancient enemy, Alshandra's high priestess Raena, who will use any means to destroy him. Their confrontation could turn the tide of the siege--and change the fate of Deverry forever.</p><p><b>Katharine Kerr</b> first became involved in the field of fantasy through role-playing games, feeling so intrigued that she began writing articles for gaming magazines and for some time was a contributing editor to&nbsp;<i>Dragon</i>&nbsp;magazine. This interest soon led her into the field of fantasy writing, with her first Deverry novel,&nbsp;<i>Daggerspell</i>, appearing in 1986. Since then, Kerr has written many more fantasy and science fiction novels. Her Deverry series has hit&nbsp;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Times</i>&nbsp;(London) and the Australian bestseller lists.PROLOGUE<br> the Northlands, 1116<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> ALBUS<br> &nbsp;<br> The opposite of Rubeus in all things, thus generally an omen for good. Yet when it falls into the House of Lead, pertaining to matters of war, it does signify days of air and darkness, and an evil upon the land.<br> &#x2014;The Omenbook of Gwarn,<br> Loremaster<br> &nbsp;<br> Under a starry night two men and a dragon camped by a river. Though the wind blew warm, the men had built a fire for light, and the great wyrm laid her head as close to it as she dared. The rest of her glittering body and folded wings stretched away into shadow. Well over twenty feet long, not counting the tail curled round her haunches, the greenish-black dragon kept raising her head to look about her and sniff the summer wind. On the opposite side of the fire sat a young man of the Mountain People, though he was tall for one of them at five-and-a-half feet. He had high dwarven cheekbones and a flat nose, narrow eyes, shadowed under heavy dwarven brows, and his hair was a brown close to black, as was his close-cropped beard. Every time the dragon went on guard, he would start up, then mutter a curse under his breath and sit again.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rori?&#x201d; he said finally. &#x201c;What be troubling the beast?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rhodry Maelwaedd stopped his restless pacing and walked back into the pool of firelight. He was well over six-feet-tall but built straight from shoulder to hip, and his raven-dark hair and cornflower blue eyes marked him for an Eldidd man, even though that province lay hundreds of miles to the south, all the way across the far-flung kingdom of Deverry. Weather-beaten, grizzled, Rhodry was still a handsome man, and he looked human enough&#x2014;at first glance, anyway.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pity you never learned the Elvish tongue, Enj. It&#x2019;s the only thing she speaks.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And where would I have come across elves, all the way up here? Well, before I met you, anyway.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;True spoken.&#x201d; Rhodry turned to the dragon and began speaking in the language of his father&#x2019;s people. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong? Do you smell trouble on the wind?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What? No, not yet, anyway.&#x201d; The dragon&#x2019;s voice rumbled and growled like a turning millstone. &#x201c;But I like to keep a bit of a guard.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sensible enough, and my thanks.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She rippled her long wings, then rested her head on her coppery-green paws, though she kept an eye open to watch him. On the third finger of his right hand, Rhodry wore a silver ring, a flat band inscribed on the outside with a design of roses and on the inside, with her true name.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Naught&#x2019;s wrong.&#x201d; Rhodry sat down on the ground a few feet from Enj and spoke in the rough patois of Deverrian and the mountain tongue that they both could understand. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s just troubled, like we are.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a miserable bad day, truly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rhodry laughed, a high mad chortle of a berserker&#x2019;s howl that made Enj wince and the dragon raise her head to hiss like a thousand cats.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You must admit, Enj old lad, that you&#x2019;ve a fine gift for understatement. You&#x2019;ve lost home and kin both, and I&#x2019;ve lost a woman I loved with all my heart and soul, and what do you call it? A miserable bad day. Well, truly, it was that, I suppose.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My apologies, then!&#x201d; Enj snarled like the dragon. &#x201c;But ye gods, what do you expect me to do? Orate like one of your wretched bards?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rhodry wiped his grin away.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. Forgive me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The two men stared at each other for a long moment; then Enj held out his hand. Rhodry shook it. His mouth set hard against mourning, Enj returned to watching flames dance along logs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rhodry&#x2019;s heavy sword belt lay beside him on the ground. He pulled a dagger free of its sheath and began fiddling with it, polishing the narrow blade on his sleeve, holding it up to catch the light. When he flicked it with a thumbnail, the blade rang like silver, though it was as hard as steel. The dragon&#x2019;s coppery eye followed every glint.<br> &nbsp;<br> Their camp lay in a broad valley where a river flowed through scattered pines and high grass. All round rose the mountains of the Roof of the World, in those days untrod and unsettled by either dwarf or man. Framing the valley, hills climbed, dark with trees, while beyond them rose the high peaks, their perpetual snow gleaming a faint silver in the light from the overarching stars. Down from the foothills, the night wind brought them the sound of wolves howling on the hunt. Arzosah raised her massive head to listen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re moving away from us,&#x201d; she remarked. &#x201c;I do wish you&#x2019;d sheathe that knife, Rori. It&#x2019;s driving me daft, watching you play with it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He smiled and closed one broad hand round its hilt.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You know,&#x201d; she went on, &#x201c;if you need someone to hate, you could blame Evandar. I do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For what? The vanishing of Haen Marn?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nah, nah, nah. What do I care about your stupid island? It wasn&#x2019;t my home. I blame him for the troubling of me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I should have known.&#x201d; Rhodry translated this exchange for the puzzled Enj, then turned back to her. &#x201c;Well, if he hadn&#x2019;t given me this little ring, you&#x2019;d be all nice and snug, sure enough, lolling round in your fire mountain and chewing on a cow bone or two.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mock! It&#x2019;s bad enough you&#x2019;ve enslaved me. Don&#x2019;t mock me, too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Watch your courtesies when you speak to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She whined, rolling an enormous copper eye to the stars. He held up his hand to catch the firelight on the ring.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My apologies,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a harsh man, Rhodry Dragonmaster.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I intend to stay that way and stay alive.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She whined again, flopping her head onto her paws. He glanced at Enj to find him utterly expressionless.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We should turn in,&#x201d; Rhodry said. &#x201c;Think you can sleep?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not without dreaming. Let&#x2019;s let the fire burn awhile.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Very well.&#x201d; He looked at the dragon, who was quietly snarling to herself. &#x201c;Still thinking of Evandar?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. If ever I find him again, I&#x2019;m going to eat him. Munch crunch gobble gone.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A fine sentiment, but I&#x2019;m afraid you can&#x2019;t really eat him. He doesn&#x2019;t have a real body, not one made out of meat, I mean, like you and me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Just like him! The final cheat of all!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A spiteful beast, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The voice came out of the dark beyond the fire. His dagger in hand, Rhodry scrambled to his feet as a figure strolled toward them. A silver glow like moonlight hung in the air round him so that they could see him clearly, a tall fellow, slender, dressed in a long green tunic and buckskin trousers. His hair was the bright yellow of daffodils, his lips were the red of sour cherries, and his eyes were an unnatural turquoise blue, bright as gemstones. Yet the strangest thing of all were his ears, long and delicately pointed, furled tight like a fern in spring.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Evandar!&#x201d; Rhodry hissed.<br> &nbsp;<br> The dragon slapped her tail upon the ground with a dull boom like an avalanche. He could hear her scuffling to her feet behind him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The very one.&#x201d; Evandar made him a bow, then raised one hand to point a long and slender finger at the dragon. &#x201c;Arzosah Sothy Lorezohaz! Remember that I know your name.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She snarled, opening her mouth wide, but she held her place. Enj crouched by the fire and stared at their visitor.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What brings you here?&#x201d; With a nod Enj&#x2019;s way to include him, Rhodry spoke in the Deverrian patois.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A warning for you,&#x201d; Evandar said in the same. &#x201c;Are you heading south?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We are. Cengarn&#x2019;s under siege. Did you know that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course. I know everything that&#x2019;s worth knowing about this war, Rhodry Maelwaedd.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, do you now? Then where&#x2019;s the relieving army? We&#x2019;ll be looking to join up with it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go to Lin Serr first. Garin and his troop of axmen haven&#x2019;t left yet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What? I&#x2019;d have thought them long gone.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s an obstacle in their way.&#x201d; Evandar flashed him a grin. &#x201c;A small army&#x2019;s tramping round the countryside. Horsekin.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Enj winced and swore.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The filthy bastards!&#x201d; Rhodry said, half-laughing. &#x201c;I want a chance at killing me a few.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get it,&#x201d; Evandar said. &#x201c;But stay on guard while you&#x2019;re flying south, because there&#x2019;s some peculiar birds who soar between worlds, and I think me one of them means you harm.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Shape-changers!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Evandar smiled, briefly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the raven I&#x2019;d watch out for. A bird of ill omen, always, but particularly ill-omened is the raven I have in mind. You&#x2019;re wearing some sort of talisman of hiding, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I thought so. No doubt your enemies are having a fair bit of trouble scrying you out, and so they&#x2019;ll have to come look for you in the flesh. Be careful, very careful. The raven woman&#x2019;s as dangerous as they come.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll keep alert, then, and my thanks. Answer me somewhat, will you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Probably not, but you can ask. I only set riddles. I don&#x2019;t answer them for naught.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The dragon swung her head his way and growled. Oho! Rhodry thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right, then,&#x201d; Rhodry said aloud. &#x201c;Why would you come to warn me? I don&#x2019;t recall ever doing anything for you, and yet you&#x2019;ve helped me a good many times now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. It&#x2019;s a riddle I&#x2019;ve set for myself, a riddle as new and shiny as a gold coin, and here I never meant to do such a thing.&#x201d; Evandar tilted his head a little to one side, suddenly solemn, and yet it seemed that he was acting the role of a man thinking rather than truly thinking something through. &#x201c;I suppose there&#x2019;s only one thing the answer could be.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And that is?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Evandar laid a hand along the side of Rhodry&#x2019;s face, then kissed him full on the mouth. His hand felt oddly cool, more like silk than flesh, but the kiss was warm enough. Rhodry could neither move nor think till Evandar released him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Free PR: How to Get Chased By The Press Without Hiring a PR Firm</h2><p>Public relations has always been an essential part of doing business which is probably why you're shelling out big money to an outside PR firm.

Theologian Peter Bouteneff explores how firstmillennium Christian understandings of creation can inform current thought in the church and in the public square. He reaches back into the earliest centuries of our era to recover the meanings that early Jewish and Christian writers found in the stories of the six days of creation and of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Readers will find that their forbears in the faith saw in the Genesis narrative not simply an account of origins but also a rich teaching about the righteousness of God, the saving mission of Christ, and the destiny of the human creature.</p><p>"This wonderfully researched and elegantly written book provides the reader with a compelling and trustworthy portrait of how the fathers of the church read the story of Adam and Eve. As Bouteneff tells that story we see that the tale of the fall is always contextualized within a narrative that celebrates the restoration and redemption of the human race."--<b>Gary Anderson</b>, professor of Old Testament, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"<i>Beginnings</i> takes us back to the beginning of the scriptural creation narrative and to the beginning of the Christian appropriation of this narrative. The reader is initiated into precursors of the Christian tradition (especially the Septuagint and Philo) and then guided through the early Christian thinkers (especially Origen) whose writings underpin current theological reflection on Genesis 1-3. <i>Beginnings</i> allows twenty-first-century readers to wrestle with issues ranging from creation and the image of God to anthropology and gender--all in the context of the community of faith that found its beginning, middle, and end in Jesus Christ. Peter Bouteneff has done the church a valuable service in this focused study."--<b>Joel C. Elowsky</b>, managing editor, Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, Drew University<br><br>"The question of the origin of humankind and the cosmos has perhaps never been so hotly debated as nowadays, with 'evolution' and 'creationism' presenting themselves as polar opposites. In this fine book, Peter Bouteneff presents a carefully researched and scholarly reading of early Christian readings of the creation account in Genesis. What emerges is a range of interlocking insights into God's creative purpose and the human place in the cosmos. Genesis 1-3 is seen as neither a myth nor an outdated scientific account, but a poem of creation, yielding deeper meanings upon closer ponderings. Bouteneff unveils the often surprising riches of our patristic inheritance with a rare intelligence and passion."--<b>Andrew Louth</b>, professor of patristic and Byzantine studies, University of Durham<b>Peter C. Bouteneff </b>(DPhil, University of Oxford) is associate professor of theology at St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, New York.

He was a leader of the abolitionist movement, a celebrated writer, an esteemed speaker, and a social reformer, proving that, as he said, &#x201c;Once you learn to read, you will be forever free.&#x201d; </p><p>The story of one of America&#x2019;s most revered figures is brought to life by the text of award-winning author Walter Dean Myers and the sweeping, lush illustrations of artist Floyd Cooper.</p></p><p><p>Walter Dean Myers was the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Monster</em>, the winner of the first Michael L. Printz Award; a former National Ambassador for Young People's Literature; and an inaugural NYC Literary Honoree. Myers received every single major award in the field of children's literature. He was the author of two Newbery Honor Books and six Coretta Scott King Awardees. He was the recipient of the Margaret A. Edwards Award for lifetime achievement in writing for young adults, a three-time National Book Award Finalist, as well as the first-ever recipient of the Coretta Scott King-Virginia Hamilton Award for Lifetime Achievement.</p><br><br><p>Floyd Cooper received a Coretta Scott King Award for his illustrations in <em>The Blacker the Berry</em> and a Coretta Scott King Honor for <em>Brown Honey in Broomwheat Tea</em> and <em>I Have Heard of a Land</em>. Born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Mr. Cooper received a degree in fine arts from the University of Oklahoma and, after graduating, worked as an artist for a major greeting card company. In 1984, he came to New York City to pursue a career as an illustrator of books, and he now lives in Easton, Pennsylvania, with his wife and children.</p>Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;This picture book biography draws on Frederick Douglass's autobiographies to examine his motivations and his lasting impact on U.S. history. Using erasers and oil on board, Cooper conveys Douglass's determination, portraying him as strong and serious even as a child. The artwork depicts Douglass's growing awareness that a life outside of slavery might be possible. The events covered are well chosen to give young readers insight into the essence of his life and accomplishments. In a child-appropriate manner, the text describes beatings, but the illustrations do not show scars. When Douglass was 16, his owner realized that the teen's independent spirit might be problematic. The owner sent Douglass to another man, Edward Covey, whose mistreatment of slaves often caused them to back down. In a dramatic spread, Douglass is shown standing over Covey as the older man crouches on the ground, Douglass clearly the victor in their confrontation: an image that emphasizes the spirit that drove him to stand up for himself and other African Americans through the abolitionist movement. A time line provides context and further details about Douglass's life. VERDICT Although this title is similar in scope to Doreen Rappaport's Frederick's Journey, the two books complement each other. Recommended for collections looking to further explore Douglass's legacy.&#x2014;Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</p><h2>How to Draw Fun Flying Vehicles: From Hang Gliders to Drones (How to Draw Series)</h2><p><b>Give budding young artists the tools they need to let their creativity soar!</b><br><br>These small but informative drawing books will help children discover and expand on their creative drawing talent.

We live in an age of strife and division. Factors such as race, class, values and lifestyles keep us from connecting with others in meaningful ways. It&#39;s easy to avoid or ignore those who make us uncomfortable and those we simply do not like, but God&#39;s call to the church is to do just the opposite. Leroy Barber has spent decades pursuing reconciliation and justice amongst groups of vastly diverse people. He knows the challenge of embracing those who are difficult to embrace, yet he advocates that the way to radical shalom on earth is through pursuing these relationships. We have the opportunity as the people of God to bring true peace and unity to a world that desperately needs it. Embrace the challenge to show a divided world the bridge-building power of God&#39;s love.</p><p>Leroy Barber is the chaplain of Kilns College, director of the Voices Project, and the author of <em>Red, Brown, Yellow, Black, White</em> and <em>Everyday Missions</em>. He is on the boards of several organizations, including Missio Alliance and the Christian Community Development Association. He and his family live in Portland, Oregon."Leroy Barber has been on the frontlines of the struggle for racial justice for many years now. In his new book <em>Embrace</em>, he makes the case for why deeper and more loving relationships, especially with people who are unlike us, hold the key to creating God's kingdom here on earth and repairing the breaches in our lives and societies. Leroy's book employs powerful personal examples, accessible prose, insightful social analysis, and a mastery of Scripture that together make this a must-read for anyone who is concerned with our future together as a human family in a broken world so loved by God. He shows that talk isn't enough&#x2015;that we need to repair the breaches we have caused and allowed in both our relationships and our systems. Leroy Barber is making a powerful case today for why leaders of color need our strongest affirmation and support, especially in faith-based and other critical nonprofit organizations, if we are to move forward." (Jim Wallis, president, Sojourners, editor in chief, Sojourners, New York Times bestselling author of America's Original Sin)<br><br>"A powerful book for these times. The weave of the biblical story, current times, and the personal journey of Leroy Barber bring the reader to more fully understand, embrace, and find the courage to live out radical shalom. I believe this book should be read by every person who is a Christ follower. Could it be the groundbreaker for the racial healing that is so desperately needed and that our Lord desires to accomplish? An unequivocal yes!" (Jo Anne Lyon, general superintendent, The Wesleyan Church)<br><br>"Troubled times require God's people to rise up and embody God's shalom. Leroy Barber fully understands the world we live in. His life and ministry reveal a deep concern for our divided and broken world. He not only writes about shalom relationships but also demonstrates them in his own life and ministry. This book will lead you through important but sometimes difficult concepts and issues that can strengthen the church and direct you toward an embodied life of godly relationships that we will do well to emulate." (Soong-Chan Rah, Milton B. Engebretson Professor of Church Growth and Evangelism, North Park Theological Seminary, author of Prophetic Lament)<br><br>"With powerful stories and fresh insight, Leroy challenges us to fall in love with hard places and see the image of God in hard people. We are reminded that the hard places are exactly where we need to be. <em>Embrace</em> illustrates the many ways God uses difficult situations in life to help us love more deeply and bring us closer to one another and God." (Shawn Casselberry, executive director, Mission Year)<br><br>"Leroy Barber offers a simple yet deeply profound invitation to return to a foundation of relationship. <em>Embrace</em> is very timely with helpful insights for today's increasingly divided world. Barber challenges us to look and find the unexamined prejudices that lead us to further alienation from those God brings into our lives. A great book for those longing for depth and true transformation in their relationships." (Nikki Toyama-Szeto, director, IJM Institute for Biblical Justice and author of God of Justice)<br><br>"<em>Embrace</em> is an important book for this <em>kairos</em> moment in history. Many of us in the church long for true racial reconciliation. We want to be peacemakers in this broken and angry world. However, we often lack concrete, down-to-earth, timely, and biblically based tools for building real relationships across the lines. Rev. Barber has given us a wealth of wisdom for how to make these dreams real. He helps us understand and, yes, embrace one another." (Alexia Salvatierra, pastor, founder, The Faith-Rooted Organizing UnNetwork, coauthor of Faith-Rooted Organizing)<br><br>"In <em>Embrace</em> Leroy Barber shows us that loving our neighbor includes knowing and relating to one another. With years of wisdom and experience, Leroy beautifully and patiently shows us how we can become the beloved community we were created to be. If you're looking for a practical and hopeful book to help you navigate some of the deep divides that plague our culture, look no further. This book is insightful, encouraging, and a delight to read!" (Ken Wytsma, president, Kilns College, author of Pursuing Justice and Create vs. Copy)<br><br>"Through <em>Embrace</em>, Leroy gives us a lens through which to view both the challenges and opportunities for people of faith building community through nurturing relationships. His storytelling approach shows us the importance of empathy, compassion, and having a desire to learn by listening to the journeys of those who are not like us. <em>Embrace</em> is a practical road map for radically living into God's shalom in a divided world. With over thirty years of experience in building community both domestically and internationally, there is no better person than Leroy Barber to show us the power of living into God's embrace of diversity." (Romal Tune, senior advisor to the president, The Mission Society for Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives, CEO, Clerestory: Ministry and Leadership in a New Light)<br><br>"In the Bible, righteousness is all about relationships. To be righteous means to be rightly related with all those elements that make up human life. And God knows we can all do with some help in this regard. My dear friend Leroy is a man who knows how to enhance his world through loving relationships. In this book he helps us be more righteous in very practical, joy-filled, and life-giving ways." (Debra Hirsch, author of Redeeming Sex and Untamed)<br><br>"We live in an era of polarization, where everyone is encouraged to choose a label, to associate only with others who carry the same label, and to view all others as the enemy. It is to this deeply divided world that Leroy Barber's <em>Embrace</em> speaks. Deftly weaving reflections on Scripture with his long history of crossing racial, ethnic, and economic barriers, Leroy reminds us that Christian tradition calls us to be one family with those we see as radically different from ourselves. He provides concrete strategies for living in community in the midst of division and turmoil. Whether you are crossing boundaries for the first time or a seasoned practitioner of reconciliation, <em>Embrace</em> is a challenge and an inspiration to live into the Christian call to reconciliation." (Chanequa Walker-Barnes, author of Too Heavy a Yoke)</p><h2>Her Heart Can See: The Life and Hymns of Fanny J. Crosby (Library of Religious Biography (LRB))</h2><p><i>Her Heart Can See</i> offers an intimate, informed look at Fanny J. Crosby (1820&#x2013;1915), the most prolific of all American hymn writers. Having lost her sight in infancy through a doctor's negligence, Fanny went on to compose more than 9,000 hymns, as well as various other songs, cantatas, and lyrical productions. Crosby's hymns, including such all-time favorites as "Blessed Assurance," "Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior," "Jesus, Keep Me Near the Cross," "Rescue the Perishing," "Safe in the Arms of Jesus," and "I Am Thine, O Lord," continue to be sung around the world.<br><br>Celebrated in her own day for her gospel hymns, Crosby was also very publicly involved with New York City's rescue missions and with other benevolent efforts. She rubbed shoulders with the likes of Henry Clay, Grover Cleveland, Winfield Scott, Dwight L. Moody, Ira Sankey, Jenny Lind, P. T. Barnum, and many other famous figures who people these pages. More than two dozen black-and-white photographs depict the people and settings among which Crosby moved.<br><br>Drawing on primary sources -- including thousands of unpublished Crosby manuscripts -- Edith Blumhofer sorts fact from fiction in the life of this remarkable woman. Blumhofer responsibly limns Crosby's life as a gifted nineteenth-century northeastern Protestant woman, in the process showing why "this diminutive woman" was -- and is -- so beloved.</p><p>Edith L. Blumhofer is professor of history and director of the Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals at Wheaton College, Wheaton, Illinois.Anyone who has stood in church and sung "Blessed Assurance" or "Redeemed, How I Love to Proclaim It" is familiar with the work of Fanny Crosby (1820&#x2013;1915), one of America's most esteemed and prolific Protestant hymn-writers. In a marvelous new biography, Wheaton College history professor Blumhofer tells Crosby's story. The musician, blind from infancy, was educated at the New York Institute for the Blind, where she later taught. In 1858, she married Alexander van Alstine, but their marriage was unusual, in that they lived apart for lengthy spells and led largely separate lives. Though she played the piano, harp, organ and guitar, and published several volumes of poetry as a young woman, she didn't turn to hymnody until midlife. Crosby was well-educated, but she never learned to write legibly, so she composed verses in her head and remembered the words until someone turned up to take dictation; sometimes she "wrote" an entire hymn in 20 minutes. She was also active in urban mission work and gave her time to institutions like the YMCA and the Bowery Mission. Not only does Blumhofer offer a lively account of Crosby's many accomplishments, she also contextualizes Crosby's life in larger currents of American history, including the rise of Sunday schools and the mid&#x2013;19th-century movement to "elevat[e] the nation's musical taste" and "introduc[e] music into the public schools." This is a splendid and entertaining contribution to American religious history. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He is also confronted by his half brothers, who have their own agenda and seem intent on protecting the family name from any implication of wrongdoing. <br>Reyna's choice, then, is either to push through the resistance and risk what he might reveal about his past or to forsake the strange, windswept Faroe Islands for good. His decision will change the lives of everyone around him, but the truths he's already uncovered can't be reburied.<p><i>This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media.

A must-read for concerned citizens&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i>, starred review) from bestselling author Jeremy Scahill and his colleagues at the investigative website <i>The Intercept</i>.<br><br>Drones are a tool, not a policy. The policy is assassination. But drone strikes often kill people other than the intended target. These deaths, which have included women and children, dwarf the number of actual combatants who have been assassinated by drones. They have generated anger toward the United States among foreign populations and have even become a recruiting tool for jihadists.<br> <br>The first drone strike outside a declared war zone was conducted more than twelve years ago, but it was not until May 2013 that the White House released a set of standards and procedures for conducting such strikes. However, there was no explanation of the internal process used to determine whether a suspect should be killed without being indicted or tried, even if that suspect is an American citizen. The implicit message of the Obama administration has been: <i>Trust, but don&#x2019;t verify. </i><br> <br><i>The Assassination Complex </i>reveals stunning details of the government&#x2019;s secretive drone warfare program based on documents supplied by a confidential source in the intelligence community. These documents make it possible to begin the long-overdue debate about the policy of drone warfare and how it is conducted. <i>The Assassination Complex</i> allows us to understand at last the circumstances under which the US government grants itself the right to sentence individuals to death without the established checks and balances of arrest, trial, and appeal&#x2014;&#x201c;readers will be left in no doubt that drone warfare affronts morality and the Constitution&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>).</p><p>Jeremy Scahill is one of the three founding editors of <i>The Intercept</i>.

A case of polio had left her with a limp and sympathetic to those less fortunate. Traveling across the United States, documenting with her camera and her fieldbook those most affected by the stock market crash, she found the face of the Great Depression. In this picture book biography, Carole Boston Weatherford with her lyrical prose captures the spirit of the influential photographer.</p><p><b>Carole Boston Weatherford </b>is the author of several acclaimed poetry collections and poetic biographies, including <i>Gordon Parks: How the Photographer Captured Black and White America</i>, <i>Sugar Hill: Harlem&#x2019;s Historic Neighborhood</i>, and <i>Moses: When Harriet Tubman Led Her People to Freedom</i>. She lives in North Carolina. <b>Sarah Green</b> is a California born-and-based illustrator. This is her first solo book but not her first foray into children's books. She studied illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design and graduated in 2014.K-Gr 2&#x2014;Dorothea Lange saw the human misery of the Depression and photographed it, helping to bring aid to those in need. Though polio left her with a limping gait, it did not keep this remarkable woman from making a difference in the world and using her insight to tell stories with her camera. The subjects she chose&#x2014;sharecroppers in the South, migrant workers in the West, and, later, Japanese Americans in internment camps&#x2014;faced poverty and injustice. In condensing her life for this simple picture book introduction for young readers and listeners, Weatherford and Green have sadly flattened it. Without background, the intended audience is unlikely to recognize how extraordinary Lange was, especially as a woman working professionally in her time, as an advocate for social justice, and as an artist. Swiftly summarizing events in smoothly written prose, the author ends with Lange's encounter with Florence Owens Thompson, the migrant mother of her iconic photograph. The digitally painted illustrations have a 1930s look, but the grayscale images of a few of Lange's famous photographs lack the emotion of the originals. (There are three small reproductions in the back matter.)

In <i>The Blue Clerk&nbsp;</i>renowned poet Dionne Brand stages a conversation and an argument between the poet and the Blue Clerk, who is the keeper of the poet's pages. In their dialogues&#x2014;which take shape as a series of haunting prose poems&#x2014;the poet and the clerk invoke a host of writers, philosophers, and artists, from Jacob Lawrence, Lola Kiepja, and Walter Benjamin to John Coltrane, Josephine Turalba, and Jorge Luis Borges. Through these essay poems, Brand explores memory, language, culture, and time while intimately interrogating the act and difficulty of writing, the relationship between the poet and the world, and the link between&nbsp;author and art. Inviting the reader to engage with the resonant meanings of the withheld, Brand offers a profound and moving philosophy of writing and a wide-ranging analysis of the present world.</p><p>Dionne Brand is the recipient of the 2019 Blue Metropolis Violet Literary Prize, which recognizes an LGBTQ Canadian writer for their body of work and the &#34;overall contribution&#34; the writer has made to LGBTQ literature in Canada.Dionne Brand&#x2019;s collections of poetry include <i>No Language Is Neutral</i>; <i>Land to Light On</i>, winner of the Governor General&#x2019;s Literary Award and the Trillium Book Award; <i>thirsty</i>, winner of the Pat Lowther Memorial Award; <i>Inventory</i>; and, most recently, <i>Ossuaries</i>, winner of the Griffin Poetry Prize.

Is the future of Earth to be fully domesticated, an engineered global garden managed by technocrats to serve humanity? The schism between advocates of rewilding and those who accept and even celebrate a &#x201c;post-wild&#x201d; world is arguably the hottest intellectual battle in contemporary conservation.<p>In <i>Keeping the Wild</i>, a group of prominent scientists, writers, and conservation activists responds to the Anthropocene-boosters who claim that wild nature is no more (or in any case not much worth caring about), that human-caused extinction is acceptable, and that &#x201c;novel ecosystems&#x201d; are an adequate replacement for natural landscapes. With rhetorical fists swinging, the book&#x2019;s contributors argue that these &#x201c;new environmentalists&#x201d; embody the hubris of the managerial mindset and offer a conservation strategy that will fail to protect life in all its buzzing, blossoming diversity.</p><p>With essays from Eileen Crist, David Ehrenfeld, Dave Foreman, Lisi Krall, Harvey Locke, Curt Meine, Kathleen Dean Moore, Michael Soul�, Terry Tempest Williams and other leading thinkers, <i>Keeping the Wild</i> provides an introduction to this important debate, a critique of the Anthropocene boosters&#x2019; attack on traditional conservation, and unapologetic advocacy for wild nature.</p></p><p>A cast of conservation luminaries vigorously rebuts the so-called &#x201c;new environmentalism&#x201d; with its focus on domesticated &#x201c;working&#x201d; landscapes, economic growth, and corporate partnerships.George Wuerthner is the ecological projects director for the Foundation for Deep Ecology, where he does research and writes about environmental issues.

In it, Sondheim, often criticized for being cerebral, proves he can write a show's worth of lush, emotionally honest songs. Moreover, a close reading of Lapine's book reveals how much his work contributes to the show's power. Based on Italian filmmaker Ettore Scola's <i>Passione d'Amore</i> (1981) and its source, the novel <i>Fosca</i> (1869) by I. U. Tarchetti, Lapine's book has a polished singleness of purpose rare in musical theater. The dialogue is spare, and the story--about an army officer torn between two lovers, one pretty but shallow the other plain but deep--advances with breathtaking economy. It must, to make way for the songs. Yet the book does not feel incomplete; read without Sondheim's music, the libretto (Lapine's book and Sondheim's own beautiful lyrics) registers as a fully engaging, if somewhat poetic, work that stands complete in its own right. <i>Jack Helbig</i></p><h2>Moomin Book Six: The Complete Lars Jansson Comic Strip</h2><p><p><b>The first volume to be drawn and written by Lars Jansson</b></p><p>After the multifaceted Tove Jansson quit the daily grind of the newspaper comic strip, the reins were picked up by her younger brother, Lars, who&#x2013;not being an artist&#x2013;taught himself how to draw so that he could continue bringing the Moomin charm to millions of readers around the world. He wrote and drew the strip from 1961 to 1974. Without missing a beat, the transition from Tove to Lars was seamless. The delightful and gentle skewering of life's foibles continued with such antics as Moomin becoming a vegetarian; the genie from a magic lamp bringing stolen diamonds; a railway through Moominvalley turning into a roller coaster, and, of course, hijinks with international spies invading Moominvalley.</p></p><p><p><b>Lars Jansson</b> was born in 1926 and died in 2000.

It&#x2019;s the best way to compare the differences among a telephone&#x2019;s high ring, a cow&#x2019;s low moo, a fire truck&#x2019;s loud clang, and a flying string band&#x2019;s plinkety plink plunk. <i>Sounds Are High, Sounds Are Low</i> is ideal for beginning readers and hilarious practice for future sound effects pros. <i>Sounds Are High, Sounds Are Low </i>is part of the I Wonder Why book series, written to ignite the curiosity of children in grades K&#x2013;6 while encouraging them to become avid readers.

Each chapter deals with a particular theme and the book therefore may be read easily as well as being used as a commentary. Hugh Martin (1822-85) was one of the most outstanding men in that &#x201c;galaxy of gifted and devoted ministers of the Gospel&#x201d; in Scotland during the second half of the 19th century. In his writings he is unsurpassed, for &#x201c;no one could scale higher heights of sanctified eloquence.&#x201d; His works, which include &#x201c;The Shadow of Calvary,&#x201d; &#x201c;Christ&#x2019;s Presence in the Gospel History,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Atonement,&#x201d; continue to be in demand today.</p><p>Hugh Martin (1822-85) combined a brilliant analytical and mathematical mind with a child-like heart which rested in Christ and his atoning work, as revealed in the Scriptures. Born and brought up in Aberdeen, he gained the top prizes in mathematics at the University there, before going on to study for the ministry. He cast in his lot with those who left the Established Church at the Disruption and served at Panbride (Carnoustie) and Free Greyfriars, Edinburgh, until illness forced his retirement from the ministry at the age of 42.<br><br>Thereafter, he devoted himself, despite recurring ill health, to writing, preaching and continued involvement in church issues. In 1870 his <i>The Atonement: in its Relations to the Covenant, the Priesthood, the Intercession of Our Lord</i> was published (reprinted by Banner of Truth, 2013), in which he defended 'the Catholic Doctrine of the Cross', viewing the substitutionary nature of the atonement as being grounded in the covenant of grace. In recognition of his achievements, Edinburgh University conferred a Doctorate of Divinity on him in 1872.<br><br>Hugh Martin died in Dundee Royal Lunatic Asylum in June 1885, the cause of death being given as 'organic disease of brain for two years', which seems to indicate that he had been in the asylum for the last two years of his life.<br><br>Sherman Isbell has described Martin's 'eloquent theological interpretations of Bible characters and of Christ's Gethsemane experience' (Dictionary of Scottish Church History and Theology, Edinburgh, 1993), and he is remembered today for his commentary on Jonah, for his sermons <i>The Shadow of Calvary</i> and <i>Christ for Us</i>, and for his study on Simon Peter, all published by the Trust.'A first-class exposition of Jonah...all rich with good matter.' --<i>Charles H.

Did you know that Americans have spent over a trillion dollars on a Hoax? Sheldon Zerden, with the help of many doctors in his search for the truth, has compiled over 100 lies that are presented to people. If you have been diagnosed as having high blood cholesterol or are on some form of medication for the same, or you know someone who is, they must read this book. The people with the highest cholesterol counts live the longest! Read this book and demand your health advisor read this. Dr. George V. Mann calls Cholesterol the biggest scam of this century. Maybe the biggest scam of all time. The Scientific Community after 40 years and 27 clinical trials costing untold billions of dollars, has failed to show that lowering cholesterol with diet or drugs increased longevity.</p><p>The diet-heart-cholesterol connection is a fiction. It has thrived in the consciousness of the American people with the nourishment of forces in the fund-raising community, academia, the government, and the food industry. The motive for maintaining this hoax? PROFIT! <p>So says Sheldon Zerden, who has seen the myth continue unabated with billions of dollars a year in business. He says that the whole heart-healthy industry has led sane men of science astray and compromised the lives of almost everyone. He says that if the truth were admitted, this profit machine would go down in flames and take the food and pharmaceutical industries with them. </p><p>Zerden says that scientists really know that: </p><p>The reduction of dietary cholesterol does not increase the life of an individual.<br> The people who have the HIGHEST levels of cholesterol live the longest.<br> Including two whole eggs per day has shown no significant effect on serum cholesterol levels of normal humans.<br> Overwhelming evidence indicates that diet has little or nothing to do with coronary heat disease.<br> A diet for children endorsed by the American Heart Association would do serious harm to brain and mental development.</p>Sheldon Zerden is a Stock Broker in New York.

Little does he realize how prophetic this motto will be&#x2014;or how damning. For as Philip Roth follows Kepesh from the domesticity of childhood into the vast wilderness of erotic possibility, from a m�nage � trois in London to the throes of loneliness in New York, he creates a supremely intelligent, affecting, and often hilarious novel about the dilemma of pleasure: where we seek it; why we flee it; and how we struggle to make a truce between dignity and desire.</p><p>"Ranks among the major achievements in the literature of our time." &#x2014;<i>Village Voice</i><br><br>"No one writing can juggle the somber and the ludicrous more adroitly than Roth." &#x2014;<i>Time</i><br><br>"Philip Roth is a great historian of modern eroticism.... [He] speaks of a sexuality that questions itself; it is still hedonism, but it is problematic, wounded, ironic hedonism. His is the uncommon union of confession and irony. Infinitely vulnerable in his sincerity and infinitely elusive in his irony." &#x2014;Milan Kundera<br><br>"A thoughtful...elegant novel.... A fine display of literary skills." &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p>In 1997 Philip Roth won the Pulitzer Prize for <i>American Pastoral</i>.

"I realized that the interesting people and places nobody ever wrote about held more fascination for me, and for my readers, than all the governors, mayors, and city council members who never seemed to be much persuaded by my opinions anyhow. I began to collect hermits and hobos, bare-knuckled bar brawlers and bread-baking nuns, short order cooks and hockey coaches, drake mallards named Jake, and bridge tenders, band directors, bear hunters, and quiet old men who wept softly when we talked about the friends they'd left on the battlefield."<br><br>Many of the places Boxmeyer writes about are gone now, except in the memories and hearts of the people who grew up there&#x2014;Swede Hollow, the West Side Flats, Rondo Avenue, and the Upper Levee.

She can rest easy over the Christmas holiday. Right? Wrong. The ghost has disappeared, her landlord's about to sell her cottage to a hotel developer, and her brother-in-law is coming for a visit&#x2014;with one day&#x2019;s notice. She scrambles to call her spectral roomie back from beyond and find a way to save the cottage from certain destruction. But real estate takes a backseat when her brother-in-law is accused of stealing a valuable antique. Gethsemane strikes a deal with a garda investigator to go undercover as a musician at a charity ball and snoop for evidence linking antiques to a forgery/theft ring in exchange for the investigator&#x2019;s help clearing her brother-in-law. At the party, she accidentally conjures the ghost of an eighteenth-century sea captain, then ends up the prime suspect in the party host&#x2019;s murder. With the captain&#x2019;s help, she races to untangle a web of phony art and stolen antiques to exonerate herself and her brother-in-law. Then the killer targets her.

Beginning with the second edition of his work published in 1541, Calvin translated each new version into French, simultaneously adapting the text to suit lay audiences, shaping it subtly but clearly to teach, exhort, and encourage them. Besides reflecting a more pastoral bent on Calvin's part, this 1541&nbsp;<i>Institutes</i>&nbsp;is also notable as one of the founding documents of the modern French language.&nbsp;<br><br> Elsie Anne McKee's masterful translation of the 1541 French Edition -- the first-ever English version -- offers full access to the brilliant mind of John Calvin as he considered what common Christian people should all know and practice.</p><p>(1509-1564) One of the most influential reformers, his workwas of significance throughout Europe andbeyond.<br><br>Elsie Anne McKee is Archibald Alexander Professor of Reformation Studies and the History of Worship at Princeton Theological Seminary.<b>Karin Maag, H. Henry Meeter Center for Calvin Studies, Calvin College and Seminary</b><br> "This sparkling translation of John Calvin's 1541 French Institutes offers modern-day readers in the English-speaking world the opportunity to read Calvin's first version of his masterwork intended for a general audience. Elsie McKee is to be commended for her faithful yet accessible translation of this key text."<br><br><b>Henri Blocher, Facult� Libre de Theologie Evang�lique, Wheaton College Graduate School</b><br> "A major event for Calvin students! English-language readers can, at last, access and use the 1541 version of the Institutes. Scholars of repute consider this version the most admirable of all: it combines freshness and maturity, it is not overloaded with polemical developments, and, as the first theological work in the vernacular, it made a decisive contribution toward shaping modern French. It is a landmark in Calvin's corpus. Elsie McKee's translation, checked against the original French, remains scrupulously accurate, while it reads with ease and harmonious fluidity."<br><br><b>Herman J. Selderhuis, Theologische Universiteit Appeldoorn</b><br> "I am impressed with what Elsie McKee has accomplished. It is amazing how she has managed to translate Calvin's smooth French into an English that is a pleasure to read. Even more important, however, is that she has made this important work of Calvin accessible for a wide audience, so all can experience the stimulus that reading Calvin can give to the church and theology today."<br><br><b>I. John Hesselink, Western Theological Seminary</b><br> "The 1541 edition of the Institutes has long been considered a gem among the various editions of Calvin's classic. Its special virtues are that it is more concise than the final 1559 edition and also more pastoral and practical, reflecting Calvin's years in the ministry. Finally we have a superb English translation of this edition by a premier Calvin scholar. Elsie McKee knows Calvin and knows French. The result is a wonderful contribution to Calvin studies in the English-speaking world. Readers of this version will gain fresh perspectives and new insights into the Reformer's theology."<br><br><b>J. I. Packer, Regent College</b><br> "Any who wish to encounter Calvin's systematic theology at its most pastoral, freest from controversial preoccupations, and mediated through superlative translation, should devour this rendering of the Reformer's own French version of the second edition of his Institutes. This volume should win Calvin many new friends."</p><h2>The Mausoleum of Lovers: Journals 1976&#x2013;1991</h2><p>The Mausoleum of Lovers comprises Guibert&#x2019;s journals, kept from 1976&#x2013;1991.

The sensual exigencies and untempered forms of address in this epistolary work, often compared to Barthes&#x2019; A Lover&#x2019;s Discourse, use the letter and the photograph in a work that hovers between forms, in anticipation of its own disintegration.</p><p>HERV� GUIBERT (1955-1991) was a French writer and photographer.

In this powerful memoir, George Estreich, a poet and stay-at-home dad, tells his daughter's story, reflecting on her inheritance --- from the literal legacy of her genes, to the family history that precedes her, to the Victorian physician John Langdon Down's diagnostic error of "Mongolian idiocy." Against this backdrop, Laura takes her place in the Estreich family as a unique child, quirky and real, loved for everything ordinary and extraordinary about her.<br><br>"In this wise and moving memoir, George Estreich tells the story of his family as his younger daughter is diagnosed with Down syndrome and they are thrust into an unfamiliar world.

The couple has grown apart since a doctor confirmed they would never have children. Marty longs to escape the tight-knit area where large families are valued, and the opportunity to do so arises when her childhood friend, Brooke Spalding, resurfaces with the wild idea of rebuilding a ghost town into a resort community. Brooke hires Anthony to help with the construction, drawing the Hirschlers away from Indiana and into her plan, and then finds herself diagnosed with cancer. Moral complications with Brooke's vision for a casino as part of the resort and the discovery of a runaway teenager hiding on the property open up a world neither the Hirschlers nor Brooke had considered before.

She enjoys spending time with her three daughters and a bevy of grandchildren.<p><b>1</b></p><p><i>Pine Hill, Indiana</i></p><p><b>Marty Krieger Hirschler</b></p><p>Marty followed her husband to the front door, keeping enough distance between them to prevent bumping her knee against the bulky suitcase that hung from his hand. Anthony gripped the battered case&#x2019;s handle hard. Angrily hard. So hard the tendons stood out on the back of his hand. She stared at the discernible ridges and wished his angst were for the same reason as hers.</p><p>The carved front door&#x2014;one of Anthony&#x2019;s woodshop projects&#x2014;stood open, but the screen door sat firmly in its frame, the little hook latch secured to prevent the seemingly endless Indiana wind from bouncing the door against the casing. When Marty was a child and let the screen door smack into place, Mother always scolded, and Marty had determined early she wouldn&#x2019;t yell at her children for letting the screen door smack. Not that she&#x2019;d had the chance to honor the vow.</p><p>Anthony unlatched the hook with a flick of his finger and put his palm against the door&#x2019;s frame, but then he stood frozen, gazing outward. A question hovered on her lips&#x2014;<i>Have you changed your mind about going?</i> She tried to swallow the knot in her throat, but it refused to budge. No words could work their way past such a mighty lump, but her heart beat with hope.</p><p>Still facing the mesh screen, he spoke through gritted teeth. &#x201c;I hate arguing with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t argue anymore if you&#x2019;ll stay.&#x201d; The words rasped out, as if sliding over sandpaper. She worried her apron skirt in her hands, waiting, hoping he&#x2019;d take his broad hand from the door&#x2019;s wood frame and carry his suitcase back to their bedroom.</p><p>A sigh heaved from his chest. Hand still braced, he angled an unsmiling look at her. &#x201c;You know, it&#x2019;d be a lot easier on me if you&#x2019;d try to understand.&#x201d;</p><p>Easier on him? What about him making things easier on her? The hope swept away on a gust of frustration. She released the wad of fabric and raised her chin. &#x201c;I do understand. That&#x2019;s the problem. You&#x2019;d rather spend time away from me than with me.&#x201d;</p><p>He released the door and ran his hand over his face. Slowly. Drawing his tanned skin downward. Even after he lowered his hand, his lips remained downturned. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true. I go because I have to make a living.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could use your business telephone and computer to do the subcontracting. Your team of workers is dependable. They&#x2019;d perform just as well without you there acting as supervisor. You don&#x2019;t have to travel to every jobsite and oversee every project, but you choose to.&#x201d; Her voice quavered with her attempt to control her emotions. She wanted to rail at the top of her lungs, but good Mennonite wives did not raise their voices to their husbands. She&#x2019;d failed in so many other things&#x2014;at the very least she could refrain from yelling.</p><p>She clasped her hands at her waist and pressed hard against her aching stomach. &#x201c;If you have to go, then take me along.&#x201d;</p><p>He groaned. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been over this. And over it and over it. A construction site is no place for&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t go to work with you. I&#x2019;d stay in the hotel. Or do some sightseeing. At least we&#x2019;d have the evenings together.&#x201d; How she hated the long, lonely days when he was away. But then, sometimes it was lonely with him home.</p><p>Anthony drew in a breath that strained the buttons on his chambray work shirt. Thirty-six years old and more broad shouldered and muscular than he&#x2019;d been at twenty. But she hadn&#x2019;t changed, still as slender as she&#x2019;d been the day they exchanged vows. How she envied the women with broadened hips, pooching bellies, and sagging breasts.</p><p>His shoulders seemed to wilt as his lungs emptied of air. He set the suitcase on the floor with a light thud and cupped his wide hands over her shoulders. &#x201c;Martha...&#x201d; He called her Martha only when his patience was spent. He&#x2019;d called her Martha more times than she could count over the past two years.&#x201c;Noblesville is lots bigger than Pine Hill, that&#x2019;s true, but there aren&#x2019;t enough sights to see to keep you busy for a full week.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And before you say you&#x2019;ll stay in the hotel room and read, I already told you no.&#x201d; His blue eyes, usually the color of a cloudless summer sky, darkened, as if a storm brewed within. &#x201c;I need to focus on the job, on the materials, on the workers. Sure, my men can be trusted, but some of the subcontractors aren&#x2019;t honest. If I&#x2019;m not there to inspect things, they might bring me warped boards or watered-down paint, thinking they can put one over on a simpleminded Mennonite man. That&#x2019;s why I go to the sites. So my reputation doesn&#x2019;t get banged up because somebody else didn&#x2019;t do their best.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Knowing why you go doesn&#x2019;t make me any less lonely.&#x201d;</p><p>He rubbed his palms up and down her short sleeves, the firm touch sending shivers across her frame. &#x201c;Then don&#x2019;t stay here by yourself. Invite some of your friends to the house for cake and coffee. Drive to Lafayette and browse the mall.&#x201d;</p><p>She shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, then visit Dawna. You&#x2019;ve hardly gone out to the farm since she had her last baby. She&#x2019;d probably appreciate help with the other kids, especially now that school&#x2019;s out and all four of &#x2019;em are underfoot.&#x201d;</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t have hurt her more if he&#x2019;d skewered her with a sword. For him to suggest such a thing meant he didn&#x2019;t know her. Not at her core, where she desperately needed his understanding. She hugged herself and battled tears. &#x201c;I...can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>His expression hardened, and his hands stilled on her upper arms. &#x201c;Then stay here by yourself and be lonely. I don&#x2019;t know what else to tell you. But I&#x2019;ve gotta go.&#x201d; He dipped his head, his lips puckering. She shifted her face slightly, and the kiss landed next to instead of on her mouth. He released a soft snort as he let go of her and picked up the suitcase. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call when I get settled in the hotel. Bye, Marty.&#x201d;</p><p>At least he&#x2019;d called her Marty.</p><p>She trailed him as far as the edge of the porch, then remained rooted in place, bare toes curled over the gray-painted planks, arms loosely wrapped around a post. He tossed his suitcase into the bed of his pickup truck in one smooth motion and opened the driver&#x2019;s door. He paused, his head low, as if he was contemplating something important, and a tiny flicker of hope came to life in the center of her heart. Was he rethinking his decision to leave her behind? Would he let her come?</p><p>Without glancing in her direction, he jolted, climbed behind the wheel, and pulled the door shut with a firm yank. Moments later the engine roared to life. The tiny flicker was extinguished as effectively as a birthday candle from a puff of breath. As he pulled out of their gravel driveway and onto the dirt street, the neighbor&#x2019;s children darted across their grassy yard and chased after him, kicking at the billows of dust stirred up by the truck&#x2019;s rubber tires. Their laughter rubbed salt into the ever-festering wounds on Marty&#x2019;s heart, and she scuttled inside.</p><p>Even in the house she could hear the childish voices that carried through the screen, so she closed the solid inner door. Silence fell. A silence so big it threatened to consume her. Although the room was uncomfortably warm, chill bumps rose on her arms. She sent a slow glance across the neat living room, and her gaze stilled on the wide band of morning sunlight flowing through the plate-glass window. The beam glittered with hundreds of dust motes&#x2014;a shower of diamonds&#x2014;and made the pink roses on the area rug glow like rubies. So bright. So beautiful. A smile tugged at the corners of her lips.</p><p>While she watched, transfixed, the beam began to shrink. First shorter and then thinner. Thinner and thinner, until it disappeared. She hurried to the window and peered out. A large bank of clouds had drifted across the sun. The sun still glowed behind the clouds, but its beams had been erased. A sense of loss gripped Marty, and she blinked rapidly against the sting of tears.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be days in life when the S-U-N-shine hides behind a cloud, but there ain&#x2019;t any cloud so big it can hide the S-O-N-shine. So you always walk in the Sonshine, Martha Grace, you hear?&#x201d;</p><p>Great-Grandma Lois&#x2019;s gentle voice whispered from the past, and in Marty&#x2019;s memory she heard her own childish reply.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll walk in the Sonshine always. I promise.&#x201d;</p><p>Marty turned from the window with a sigh and trudged to the kitchen sink. How she&#x2019;d relished her week every summer at Granddad and Grandma Krieger&#x2019;s farm in Pennsylvania, where Granddad&#x2019;s mother, Lois, also lived. As much as she loved her grandparents, she&#x2019;d spent most of the time with her kind-faced, warbly voiced great-grandmother, who was no taller than the wire tomato cages Granddad fashioned for the garden. She taught Marty to knit scarves, embroider flowers on pillowcases, and stitch squares into little quilts and talked from morning to night about the One she loved most, the God she faithfully served.</p><p>Guilt pressed hard. Marty hadn&#x2019;t honored her promise to Great-Grandma Lois. But it wasn&#x2019;t entirely her fault. The Sonshine had stopped shining on her a long time ago. Or so it seemed.</p><p>She drained the now-cool water and ran a fresh basin. Lowering the few breakfast dishes into the steamy, sudsy water, she glanced out the small window above the sink into the backyard. Anthony&#x2019;s garage and attached workshop took up more than half the yard, leaving a narrow grassy patch with a garden at the far end. A century-old oak tree stood sentinel in the middle of the remaining yard, its branches casting shade over all but the corners of the rectangular patch of grass.</p><p>Anthony had wanted to cut down the oak and build his shop in the middle of the yard, but she&#x2019;d asked him to leave it, pointing out the sturdy limb that begged for a swing. Of course, back then she&#x2019;d envisioned a child&#x2019;s tire swing, but she had come to enjoy the double-sized cedar swing Anthony crafted for her thirty-fourth birthday almost two years ago. She&#x2019;d thanked him with manufactured enthusiasm for the gift, realizing he had meant well, but underneath she still mourned the silent message it sent. He didn&#x2019;t expect to ever hang a tire swing.</p><p>She gave herself a mental shake and returned her attention to the dishes. Her daily chores still needed to be checked off her list. By noon, they&#x2019;d be complete. Then she&#x2019;d go to her basement sewing room and work on the little quilt she should have finished weeks ago for her newest niece. The basement was cooler, and the hum of the machine would mask the otherwise deathly silence of her too-empty house.<br><br></p><p><i>Kansas City, Kansas</i></p><p><b>Brooke Spalding</b></p><p>Brooke signed her name to the bottom of the check with a flourish. She set the gold-inlaid pen aside, pulled the check from the pad with a satisfying scriiiitch, and pinched it up by opposite corners. Holding the business check at arm&#x2019;s length, she ignored the burn of acid in the back of her throat and lifted her attention to the six men seated along the sides of the long table in the bank&#x2019;s meeting room. &#x201c;Done.&#x201d;</p><p>Ronald Blackburn&#x2014;the gray-haired, big-bellied, sagging-jowled banker at her right&#x2014;inched his hand toward the check. His smooth pink palm and short, pudgy fingers absent of calluses spoke of years behind a desk. He licked his lips, a fox ready to devour a hen. But Brooke was no hen.</p><p>With a casual sweep of her arm, she presented the check to the man on her left, an unpretentious older gentleman lacking the gleam of greed that showed in every other pair of eyes around the table. She knew the gleam well. She&#x2019;d glimpsed it in her own reflection. &#x201c;Here you are, Mr. Miller. As they say, it&#x2019;s been a pleasure doing business with you.&#x201d;</p><p>The man held the check gingerly, as if fearful it would shatter. His gaze seemed locked on the amount written in black ink in her meticulous handwriting. She stifled a chortle. She&#x2019;d seen dozens of businessmen gawk at her handwritten business checks. Why use computer-generated checks if a person wrote legibly? Every one of her purchases culminated in a personally inscribed check&#x2014;what those in the corporate real estate business world called her trademark. That and her fuchsia suits, always with skirts instead of trousers.

When he lands in America, it is 1924 and New York City is the center of the universe. Henry turns to hawking cheap hooch on the Lower East Side, only to catch the attention of the mobsters who run the district. In Chicago, Henry finds a newer America alive with wild, happy music played by a man with a trumpet and bleeding lips called Louis Armstrong. But in a city also owned by the mob, Armstrong is a prisoner of his color. He needs a man--a white man--and the man he chooses is Henry Smart.</p><p>Roddy Doyle's last novel, A Star Called Henry," was chosen by the "The New York Times Book Review as one of the eleven Best Books of the Year; "The Washington Post said it was "not only Doyle's best novel yet; it is a masterpiece, an extraordinarily entertaining epic." Now Doyle, author of six bestselling novels, twice nominated for the Booker Prize and once a winner, turns his protagonist Henry Smart's rich observation and linguistic acrobatics loose on America, in an energetic saga full of epic adventures, breathless escapes, and star-crossed love. "Publishers Weekly says "Doyle just gets better and better." <br>Our Irish hero arrives in New York in 1924 to bury himself in the teeming city and start a new life; having escaped Dublin after the 1916 Rebellion, Henry Smart is on the run from the Republicans for whom he committed murder and mayhem. Lying to the immigration officer, avoiding Irish eyes that might recognise him, hiding the photograph of himself with his wife because it shows a gun across his lap, he throws his passport into the river and tries to forge a new identity. He charms his way into the noisy, tough Lower East Side, reads to Puerto Rican cigar makers, hauls bottles for a bootlegger and composes ads on sandwich boards, finally setting up his own business with the intention of making his fortune. But he makes enemies along the way among mobsters such as Johnny No and Fast Olaf. Henry hightails it out of Manhattan with a gun at his back and Fast Olaf's hustler of a half-sister on his arm. <br>This was a time when America was ripe for the picking, however, and a pair of good, strong con artists could have the world at their fingertips. The Depression was sending folksto ride the rails in search of a new life and new hope, and all trains led to Chicago. As Henry's past tries to catch up with him, he takes off on a journey to the great port, where music is everywhere: wild, happy music played by a man with a trumpet called Louis Armstrong. Armstrong needs a white man, and the man he chooses is Henry Smart. <br>The bestselling A Star Called Henry followed Henry Smart from his birth in 1902 until the age of twenty, by which time he had already had a lifetime's worth of adventures in his native Ireland. With these books, Doyle was trying in some ways to write a story like Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, starting at the beginning of his life and following him through many years of adventures. To write the new book, he had to research the vanished world of pre-war America. <br>"I went to Chicago, on the south side, to see if any of the old jazz clubs were still around. I was very keen to see what Henry would have seen as he'd stood outside, under the awnings. But all the jazz clubs that were along State Street, they're all gone; every one of them's gone. There's one that's still standing - it was, originally, The Sunset Cafe, where Louis Armstrong played, but now it's a hardware store. The Vendome Cinema, where he used to play during the intermissions, is now a parking lot for the local college. That I found upsetting. But on the other hand it was very liberating because in its absence I can invent." <br>Music, often American soul or blues, is always important in Roddy Doyle's work, often as escapism for the working-class Dubliners in the Barrytown books. Doyle grew up listening to American music and likes to write while listening to music. For Henryin America, Doyle says, "when he hears this music, he feels he's being baptized. He's new. He feels he's gotten away from Ireland. He's gotten away from the misery of it all and he's listening to this glorious celebration." <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p>"Together, [<i>A Star Called Henry</i> and <i>Oh, Play That Thing</i>] constitute one of the most remarkable achievements in recent Irish and American literature. And we&#x2019;re left with the tantalizing possibility of a third novel to follow." -<i>Atlanta Journal- Constitution</i> <br><br> "<i>Oh, Play That Thing</i> chronicles the birth of the American century, from the shores of Ellis Island through the Jazz Age and into the Great Depression.... Doyle&#x2019;s characters are too lively-too full-blooded and lusty-to be mere ciphers, and the Booker Prize-winning author gets the feel of things-jazz, regret, memory-right." -<i>Boston Phoenix</i> <br><br> "Written in a combo jazzed-up sassy poetry-rhythms part Irish, part New York street, part Chicago South Side blues... This is Doyle&#x2019;s rambunctious tale of the 20th century&#x2019;s immigrant America." -<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> <br><br> "Vibrant, punchy images come in quick succession, evoking city streets teeming with life and possibility like the gritty poetics of John Dos Passos." -<i>Philadelphia Weekly</i> <br><br> "Doyle can make music come alive like no one else. His prose will bop and bang its head to punk or bump and grind to the blues.... [And he] understands that becoming an American-whether you&#x2019;re black or Irish-is a game of improvisation, just like jazz." - <i>New York Daily News</i> <br><br> "A sprawling tale steeped in the grit, lawlessness and hardships of the early 1900s...it all unfolds in Doyle&#x2019;s bold, vivid writing that, at its best, echoes the adventure and rhythm of jazz.... By the end, he has us hooked, racing for the finish to a book we wish wouldn&#x2019;t end and eager for the final installment." -<i>Rocky Mountain News</i> <br></p><h2>The Path: Sufi Practices</h2><p>To walk the pages of Dr. Javad Nurbakhsh&#39;s book &#34;The Path: Sufi Practices&#34; is to be taken away from everything but the truth. In a word, this is the Sufi way. Arguably, the most comprehensive account available of Sufism in the contemporary world, The Path&#39;s subject, aim and goal is the very transmutation of the heart itself. Never less than clear and practical, each essay takes us through the stages required of the initiated disciple in order to purify the ego, become free from psychological conflicts and be cleansed of egotistical qualities. Particular light is shed on the master/disciple relationship, as Dr. Nurbakhsh writes, &#34;The master is the Noah of the ark of the voyagers of purity and the basis of illumination and revelation for those (disciples) who are faithfully carried away by the spiritual wind.&#34; If the Sufi&#39;s aim is to reach a state of selfless, constant remembrance of God, then, the Dhikr (the repetition of one of the names of God) is the key to its attainment. Dr. Nurbakhsh&#39;s book maps out in concise terms what it is to become emptied, to let go of negative emotions and to attain to a consciousness that polishes the heart. Sufism, we discover, is a mystical path towards the Truth where one is left with no provisions except love. Included is a rare glimpse into the Sufi ritual of Sama, described here as the practice of listening with the ear of the heart to music and poetry that might best be grasped as one being in a state so deeply plunged in love that there is no taint of self left in awareness. In this way, the sincere Sufi hears the call of God. This exceptional book is as much an educational tool as it is a manual for any seeker on the path of practical spiritual inquiry.</p><p>The author, Dr. Javad Nurbakhsh, was the Master of the Nimatullahi Sufi Order for over 55 years, prior to his death, in October 2008, at the age of 82. In addition to bringing the teachings of the Nimatullahi Sufism to the West and other parts of the world, Dr. Nurbakhsh also wrote extensively on Sufism and was responsible for the editing, publishing and translation of many classic Sufi texts that have existed previously only in manuscript form.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Persian</p><h2>Do It Yourself Bushcraft: A Book of the Big Outdoors</h2><p>Boy Scouts co-founder and avid outdoorsman "Uncle Dan" Beard provides a clear, enthusiastic introduction to the joys of camping, trapping, and outdoor survival.

He is the previous author of six books including <i>Act</i><i>ive Faith: How Christians Are Changing the Face of American Politics&nbsp;</i>and <i>Awakening:&nbsp;How America Can Turn From Moral and Economic Destruction Back to Greatness.&nbsp;</i></p><h2>Learning to Read Midrash</h2><p><p>Presenting a systematic approach to the study of midrash, each of the readings featured in this book attempts to reconstruct the reasoning behind midrashic commentary on biblical narrative. The study begins by defining what midrash is, discussing why it can be so difficult to understand, and explaining how the Jewish sages used midrash to interpret biblical text. It then explores two genres of midrash&#x2014;the parable and the midrashic story&#x2014;and utilizes detailed readings to demonstrate how to &#x201c;translate&#x201d; the language of the sages into contemporary terminology. Among the texts analyzed in the book are some of the most fascinating and complex biblical stories, including the binding of Isaac, the sin of David and Bathsheba, the book of Jonah, and Moses and the burning bush. This study conveys a sensitivity to the language and meanings of the Hebrew Bible and helps readers develop an appreciation for the language and teachings of the Jewish sages.</p></p><p><p><b>Simi Peters</b> is on the faculty of Nishmat: The Jeanie Schottenstein Center for Advanced Torah Study for Women, the Academy for Torah Initiatives and Directions, and Darchei Bina Seminary. She also serves as a text consultant for the Jewish Community Centers Association of North America&#x2019;s Ethical Start Pirkei Avot Curriculum Project.</p>I have found the author's analytical approach to the various midrashim fascinating, insightful and in keeping with a true Torah perspective.... I highly recommend this work (Learning to Read Midrash) for those who want to devise a method for studying Midrash that will bring them both to a deeper understanding of the Midrash and, ultimately, to a greater closeness with Hashem .... --Rabbi Zev Leff (Rabbi Zev Leff is the Rabbi of Moshav Matityahu and the Rosh Hayeshiva of Yeshiva Gevoha Matityahu)<br><br>Learning to Read Midrash is interesting on many levels. Firstly, it makes us aware of the fact that midrash is not simply 'stories', but rather a sophisticated branch within rabbinic literature. Even people familiar with midrashic sources may have difficulty defining exactly what midrash is, or seeing the connection between a particular midrash and the Biblical text it discusses. There has been until now little guidance on how to approach midrash systematically. But here we have a well-done presentation of a series of 16 explicated readings along with a presentation of the basics of a methodology for approaching these texts. Those who go through the very readable material will find themselves participating in a welcomed 'training program' in reading midrash, gaining new important insights into Hazal's words.<br><br>Second, the volume is another contribution to the growing Torah literature written by knowledgeable women and scholars. Simi Peters is on the faculty of Darchei Bina Seminary and Nishmat - the Jerusalem Center for Advanced Jewish Studies for Women, which has pioneered in training women to have expertise in halacha and advanced rabbinic literature. Women students now have models of women teachers to inspire them to gain proficiency in sophisticated Torah study. --Prof. Oscar Mohl, The Jewish Press<br><br>Maimonides exhorted readers not to take midrash literally, but was also forceful in advising people to read carefully between the lines, to find the meaning and allegorical intent.<br><br>His brief recommendations have been significantly expanded in Simi Peters's book, Learning to Read Midrash.<br><br>Peters's book comes after years of teaching the Hebrew Bible and trying to make sense of rabbinic literature that often defies explication. She bemoans the fact that it was difficult to offer students the tools to study midrash independently. This book seems to be a corrective for that problem.<br><br>Learning to Read Midrash begins by outlining the difficulties that both students and teachers have in communicating what it is that midrash does, and the varied methodologies it employs. Some of the problems she identifies are: the often-tenuous connection between midrash and the biblical text, the seeming implausibility of many midrashim, and the dearth of words used to articulate a problem or insight.<br><br>Broadly put, midrash does not have a singular goal.<br><br>As Peters eloquently puts it: 'Midrash explores the biblical text exhaustively, seeking both the plain sense of the text and its homiletical possibilities, without distinguishing rigidly between them.'<br><br>In order to affirm this statement, Peters spends some pages discussing the difference between pshat (the literal reading of a text) and drash (a homiletical reading) and some of the more 'rigid' distinctions that are embodied in other forms of biblical commentary. She includes the clever witticism of the late Professor Nechama Leibowitz: 'Pshat is what I say, and drash is what you say.'<br><br>The chapters that follow the introduction present specific midrashic topics - the mashal or allegory, the peticha or opening verse, the treatment of biblical personalities, and break down midrashim so the reader may better understand how to analyze them.<br><br>Unlike more academic guides, Peters's book is pedagogically grounded. A teacher may find him- or herself using the chapters as classroom units to study various types of midrash - from analyzing biblical dialogue to resolving textual discrepancies.<br><br>The book's scholarship should speak for itself, and the fact that Peters is an effective educator leaps off every page. --Erica Brown, Jerusalem Post</p><h2>Steps to the Altar</h2><p>Ninth in the Agatha Award-winning series that's been hailed as engrossing, <b>Steps to the Altar</b> finds California folk art expert Benni Harper preparing for two upcoming weddings, digging up clues to a decades-old unsolved murder-and struggling with a very personal crisis of the heart...</p><p><b>Earlene Fowler</b> was raised in La Puente, California, by a Southern mother and a Western father.

In the California coastal town of San Celina, there are weddings and wished-for weddings, plus the threatened demise of Benni&#39;s two-year marriage to police chief Gabe Ortiz, brought about by the appearance of Gabe&#39;s former female partner, Del Hernandez. Just as Benni doesn&#39;t think she can keep one more plate spinning in her busy life, two crises crop up: first, Del starts deliberately going after Gabe and lets Benni know it; second, Benni is asked to inventory four trunks full of materials possibly related to the decades-old bludgeoning death of wealthy Garvey Sullivan. Though asked only to catalogue the items, Benni becomes fascinated by the potential murder charge against Maple Sullivan, Garvey&#39;s widow. Maple fled before her husband&#39;s body was found, but she&#39;s been found &#34;guilty&#34; in the town&#39;s conscience and gossip ever since. Will Benni solve the old murder? Will her marriage survive the lust of Del Hernandez and the come-ons to herself from an acerbic sheriff&#39;s deputy? Will her best friend, cousin and grandmother all make it to their respective altars, fulfilling the prophecy of the Steps to the Altar quilt made for one couple?

The subdivision where he now lives is surrounded by nothing but muddy fields of rocks and sticks. But when Matt ventures out, his imagination kicks in. He draws a muddy, winding line and names it Snake River. A pile of rocks becomes the Dog Tooth Mountains. Just like that, Mattland is born. Soon a little girl shows up with a handful of helpful odds and ends. Piece by piece, she and Matt expand their new world with popsicle-stick bridges and scrap-paper boats. And when a rainstorm finally threatens to wash everything away, all the neighborhood kids appear and help stave off the flood. Evocative of childhood friendships and with sublime illustrations that brighten in color as the story progresses, Mattland is an inspiring ode to cooperative play.</p><p><p> <b>Hazel Hutchins</b> has written dozens of books for children and has won numerous awards, including <i>Parenting</i> magazine's Reading Magic Award.

(Kay Weisman <i>Booklist</i> 2010-01-10)<br><br>[starred review] Eloquent and beautifully illustrated... Petric's understated watercolors are an essential counterpart to Hutchins and Herbert's mature narrative, revealing the promise of new friendships before Matt himself realizes that he is no longer alone. The closing spread of his reflection in "Turtle Lake," surrounded by other children, is a standout.... Mattland has much to offer those who find themselves in a new place, and to creative souls needing inspiration. (Jayne Damron, Farmington Community Library, MI <i>School Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Mattland" is successful on all fronts... Described in spare yet evocative prose, Matt's world grows as he finds new things: a piece of tin becomes a barn; fuzzy seeds become sheep... Illustrator Dusan Petricic (who has dedicated the book to "all displaced children") has made each picture only from Matt's point of view; we see only what Matt sees. And by the end of the book, we understand what it means to him to have created "Mattland" -- he's created a home, so he can feel at home.

The plot is simple--Matt has no friends in his new neighbourhood, so he begins to draw in the mud outside his home in what looks to be a new subdivision under construction. Soon he has drawn Snake River and Turtle Lake and he creates "Mattland" out of whatever materials come to hand. Without fanfare or comment, another child shows up and hands Matt a popsicle stick. She returns to add more bits and pieces to the landscape, and then when the rains come and threaten to obliterate the increasingly complex Mattland, many hands appear to build dikes and canals to divert the flood. When the sun breaks through, a ring of smiling faces is reflected in Turtle Lake... There's a message here about not needing endless electronic devices in order to have fun, but the ease of connection with other people over a common project is the most valuable lesson illustrated by this<br> story.

Every architecture student examines the Swiss master's work. Yet, all too frequently, they rely on reproductions of faded drawings of uneven size and quality. <em>Le Corbusier Redrawn</em> presents the only collection of consistently rendered original drawings (at 1:200 scale) of all twenty-six of Le Corbusier's residential works. Using the original drawings from the Le Corbusier Foundation's digital archives, architect Steven Park has beautifully redrawn 130 perspectival sections, as well as plans, sections, and elevations of exterior forms and interior spaces. These remarkable new drawings-which combine the conceptual clarity of the section with the spatial qualities of the perspective-not only provide information about the buildings, they also help students experience specific works spatially as they learn to critically examine Le Corbusier's works.</p><p>Steven Park studied architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania. He is an architect at Solomon Cordwell Buenz in Chicago." Steven Park absolutely nails a graphic language of simple, elegant architectural rendering. The book is filled with page after page of three-dimensional digital renderings that actually speak to a timeless craft of draftsmanship. Subtle coloring at glazing and shadow lines at relief allow the drawing to pop off the page. The text establishes a graphic language that is everything it needs to be and nothing more. This is our new favorite book and we highly recommend picking up a copy." -- Build blog<br><br>"Park's book is extremely valuable for collecting 26 of the architect's houses in one place, with orthographic drawings all to the same scale. The sectional perspectives are extremely well done, but they would be incomplete without these 2-D drawings, especially the floor plans. Of course, as Park points out in his preface, the drawings cannot be a substitute for "walking through a building, measuring its dimensions with hands and arms ... [grasping] the relationship between the representation and reality." Yes, such is the case with all architecture, but even for moments after one has been able to visit one of Corbusier's houses, this book is a great collection of his great houses." -- Archidose.org<br><br>"Park uses sectional perspectives of 22 houses by the Swiss icon to convey the evolution of his design philosophy. The book's concept sounds simple, and indeed its black-and-white design is pleasingly streamlined. But it actually accomplishes several tasks at once. Concise descriptions of the projects help place them in the continuum of Corbu's work, and provide readers with an abbreviated but informative outline of his career. And the combination of sectional perspectives for the 22 chosen houses, along with plans, sections, and elevations for these and 4 more residences, really deepens the reader's experience. It focuses our attention on the homes' spatial complexities and their dexterous detailing." -- Residential Architect</p><h2>Naked Communist</h2><p>A timely update to the phenomenal national bestseller. Soon after its quiet release during the height of the Red Scare in 1958, The Naked Communist: Exposing Communism and Restoring Freedom exploded in popularity, selling almost two million copies to date and finding its way into the libraries of the CIA, the FBI, the White House, and homes all across the United States. From the tragic falls of China, Korea, Russia, and the UN, to the fascinating histories of Alger Hiss, Whittaker Chambers, Elizabeth Bentley, and General MacArthur, The Naked Communist lays out the entire graphic story of communism, its past, present, and future. After searching unsuccessfully for a concise literature on the communist threat, W. Cleon Skousen saw the urgent need for a comprehensive book that could guide the American conversation. So he distilled his FBI experience, decades of research, and more than one hundred communist books and treatises into one clarifying, readable volume that became a touchstone of American values and earned praise from the likes of President Ronald Reagan, Glenn Beck, and Ben Carson. Lauded by one reviewer as &#x201c;the most powerful book on communism since J. Edgar Hoover&#x2019;s Masters of Deceit,&#x201d; this text draws a detailed picture of the communist as he sees himself: stripped of propaganda and pretense. Readers gain a unique insight into the inner workings of communism&#x2014;its appeal, its history, its basic and unchanging concepts, even its secret timetable of conquest. Among the many questions The Naked Communist answers are: * Who gave the United States&#x2019; nuclear secrets to the Russians? * How did the FBI fight communism after it was forced underground in 1918? * Why did the West lose 600 million allies after World War II? * What really happened in Korea? * What is communism&#x2019;s great secret weapon? * What lies ahead? * What can I do to stop communism? * How can we fight communism without a major war? Now updated for 2017, this edition includes a chapter on the forty-five Communist Goals, detailing how forty-four of those goals have been achieved in the U.S. already, as well as a chapter on the making of The Naked Communist, shedding light on how this book has sold almost two million copies. As relevant now as it was sixty years ago, Skousen&#x2019;s groundbreaking work provides a renewed understanding of one of the greatest threats facing America today.</p><p>W. Cleon Skousen is best remembered as a national bestselling author, speaker, and teacher who lectured in every state and province in North America, and in more than sixty countries worldwide. He was a student of history and a scholar of law, specializing in the principles of freedom, the U.S. Constitution, economics, and ancient history and scriptures. Skousen was invited to write a new constitution for Canada and the proposed United States of Latin America, and he published a model constitution that could be adopted by nations everywhere. He served in the FBI for sixteen years, as Chief of Police in Salt Lake City for four years, and as a university professor for ten years. He was a prolific writer and produced three national bestsellers: The Naked Communist, The Naked Capitalist, and The 5000 Year Leap. Eight of his books were used as college texts, and several were translated and published in other countries.&nbsp; His seminars on the Constitution have been taught to several million people across the U.S., and among his students were dozens of U.S. senators and representatives, two Supreme Court justices, and several presidential candidates. He believed knowledge and understanding were key to maintaining a free country, and he spent his entire adult life opening up complex issues for deeper understanding by students and audiences all around the world. Skousen was born in Canada and returned to the U.S. with his family at age ten. He spent two years in Mexico and two years in England, then graduated from San Bernardino College in California and received his JD from George Washington University Law School. He was admitted to practice law in the District of Columbia and before the District Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. Skousen and his wife, Jewel Pitcher of San Bernardino, California, are the parents of 8 children, 50 grandchildren, and more than a 150 great-grandchildren.&nbsp; For more information, please contact info@izzardink.com.<p>&#x201c;No one is better qualified to discuss the threat to this nation from communism.

So you must collect those books. It&#x2019;s an idea I read from Cleon Skousen from his book in the 1950s, <em>The Naked Communist</em>, where he talked about [how] someday the history of this country&#x2019;s going to be lost because it&#x2019;s going to be hijacked by intellectuals and communists and everything else. And I think we&#x2019;re there.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Glenn Beck, host of the nationally syndicated <em>Glenn Beck Radio Program</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;<em>The Naked Communist </em>lays out the whole progressive plan.

Edgar Hoover, first Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong><br> <br> &#x201c;We believe in a moral code. Communism denies innate right or wrong. As W. Cleon Skousen has said in his timely book, <em>The Naked Communist</em>: The communist &#x2018;has convinced himself that nothing is evil which answers the call of expediency.&#x2019; This is a most damnable doctrine. People who truly accept such a philosophy have neither conscience nor honor. Force, trickery, lies, broken promises are wholly justified.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Ezra Taft Benson, United States Secretary of Agriculture under President Eisenhower</strong></p></p><h2>Deep Secret</h2><p>A fantasy adventure about saving the universe one world at a time from Diana Wynne Jones. The companion novel to the bestselling The Merlin Conspiracy. Magids look after all worlds, steer them towards magic, and keep history happening. But Rupert Venables&#39; mentor has just died, and as the junior magid on earth he has to find a replacement while also trying to find the lost heir of a collapsing empire, worlds away. Rupert interweaves the fate lines to get all the candidates together at a sci-fi fantasy convention, and havoc ensues as they all converge on a very strange hotel, where everything is always linked, the walls keep moving, people are trying to kill him, and nothing is as it seems...a magical, epic story from the Godmother of fantasy.</p><p>Diana Wynne Jones (1934-2011) spent her childhood in Essex and began writing fantasy novels for children in the 1970s. With her unique combination of magic, humour and imagination, she enthralled generations of children and adults with her work. She won the Guardian Award in 1977 with Charmed Life, was runner-up for the Children&#39;s Book Award in 1981 and was twice runner-up for the Carnegie Medal.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>ONE<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I may as well start with some of our deep secrets because this account will not be easy to understand without them.</p><p><br>All over the multiverse, the sign for Infinity or Eternity is a figure eight laid on its side. This is no accident, since it exactly represents the twofold nature of the many worlds, spread as they are in the manner of a spiral nebula twisted like a M�bius strip to become endless. It is said that the number of these worlds is infinite and that more are added daily. But it is also said that the Emperor Koryfos the Great caused this multiplicity of worlds somehow by conquering from Ayewards to Naywards.</p><p><br>You may take your pick, depending on whether you are comfortable with worlds infinitely multiplying, or prefer to think the number stable. I have never decided.</p><p><br>Two facts, however, are certain: one half of this figure eight of worlds is negative magically, or Naywards, and the other half positive, or Ayewards; and the Empire of Koryfos, situated across the twist at the centre, has to this day the figure-eight sign of Infinity as its imperial insignia.<br>This sign appears everywhere in the Empire, even more frequently than statues of Koryfos the Great. I have reason to know this rather well. About a year ago, I was summoned to the Empire capital, Iforion, to attend a judicial enquiry. Some very old laws required that a Magid should be present&#x2014;otherwise I am sure they would have done without me, and I could certainly have done without them. The Koryfonic Empire is one of my least favourite charges. It is traditionally in the care of the most junior Magid from Earth and I was at that time just that. I was tired too. I had only the day before returned from America, where I had, almost single-handed, managed to push the right people into sorting out some kind of peace in the former Yugoslavia and Northern Ireland. But all my pride and pleasure in this vanished when I saw the summons. Groaning to myself, I put on the required purple bands and cream silk brocade garments and went to take my seat in the closed court.</p><p><br>My first peevish, jet-lagged thought was, Why can&#x2019;t they use one of the nice rooms? The great Imperial Palace has parts that go back over a thousand years and some of those old courts and halls are wonderful. But this enquiry was in a new place, lined with rather smelly varnished wood, bleak and box-like and charmless. And the wooden benches were vilely uncomfortable. The figure-eight insignia&#x2014;carved in relief and painted too bright a gold&#x2014;dug into my shoulders and dazzled off the walls and off the big wooden chair provided for the Emperor. I remember irritably transferring my gaze to the inevitable statue of Koryfos the Great, looming in the corner. That was new too, and picked out in over-bright gilt, but there is this to be said for Koryfos: he had a personality. Though the statues are always the same and always idealized, you could never mistake them for anything but the likeness of a real person. He carried his head on one side, a bit like Alexander the Great of Earth, and wore a vague, cautious smile that said, &#x201c;I hear what you say, but I&#x2019;m going to do things my way anyway.&#x201d; You could see he was obstinate as sin.</p><p><br>I remember I was wondering why the Empire so loved Koryfos&#x2014;he reigned for a bare twenty years over two millennia ago, and most of the time he was away conquering places, but they persist in regarding his time as the Golden Age&#x2014;when we had to stand up for the entrance of the present Emperor. A very different person, small, plain and dour. You do wonder how it is that Emperors always marry the most beautiful women in several worlds and yet produce someone like Timos IX whom you would hardly notice in the street. You would glance at him and think that this was a short man with weak eyes and a chip on his shoulder. Timos IX was one of very few in the Empire who needed to wear glasses. This embarrassed me as I stood up. I was the only other person in the court in spectacles&#x2014;as if I were setting up to be the Emperor&#x2019;s equal. In many ways, of course, a Magid <i>is</i> the equal of any ruler, but in this particular court of enquiry I was a mere onlooker, there by law to certify simply whether or not the accused had broken the law as stated. I was not even supposed to speak until after a verdict had been reached.</p><p><br>This, among other legal facts, was tediously made known to me in the preliminaries after, we all sat down and the prisoner was marched in and made to stand in the centre. He was a pleasant-looking youngster of twenty-one or so, called Timotheo. He did not look like a law-breaker. I am afraid that, apart from registering, with some perplexity, that Timotheo was an alias and that, for obscure legal reasons, his real name could not be given, I could not force my jet-lagged mind to attend very well. I remember going back to my thoughts of Koryfos the Great. He stood to the Empire in the place of a religion, it seemed to me. The wretched place had religions in plenty, over a thousand godlets and goddities, but the worship of these was a purely personal thing. As an example of how personal, I recalled that Timos IX had, about fifteen years ago, adopted the worship of a peculiarly unlovable goddess who inhabited a bush planted on the grave of a dead worshipper and who imposed on her followers a singularly joyless code of morals. This probably explained the Emperor&#x2019;s pinched and gloomy look. But no one else at court had felt the need to adopt the Emperor&#x2019;s faith. It was Koryfos who united everyone.</p><p><br>Here I was jerked to alertness. The Emperor himself read out the charges against the young man in elaborate legal language. Stripped of the law-talk it was appalling, even for the Empire. The so-called Timotheo was the Emperor&#x2019;s eldest son. The decree he was said to have broken stated that no child of the Emperor, by any of his True Wives, High Ladies or Lesser Consorts, was to know who his or her parents were. The penalty for discovering who they were was death. And death for anyone who helped an Imperial child find out.</p><p><br>The Emperor then asked Timotheo if he had broken this decree.</p><p><br>Timotheo had evidently known no more of this decree than I had. He was looking as shocked and angry as I felt. I could have applauded when he answered drily, &#x201c;Sire, if I hadn&#x2019;t broken it before, I would have broken it when you read out my parentage just now.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;But have you broken the decree?&#x201d; the Emperor reiterated.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Timotheo.</p><p><br>Catch-22, I thought. I was furious. What a charade!</p><p><br>The worst of it was that Timotheo was intelligent as well as pleasant. He would have made a much better Emperor than his father. It had obviously taken some ingenuity to find out who he was. He had been one of four fosterlings in the house of a provincial noble and, as the enquiry proceeded, it became clear that the other three fosterlings and the noble must have given him some help. But Timotheo stuck to it that he had done the detective work and made the discovery by himself. Then he had made the bad mistake of writing to his mother, the Emperor&#x2019;s First Consort, for confirmation.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Did it not occur to you that, once you were known, my enemies might kidnap you in order to threaten me?&#x201d; the Emperor asked him.</p><p><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t going to tell anyone,&#x201d; Timotheo said. &#x201c;Besides, I can look after myself.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;Then you were intending to claim the Imperial throne for yourself,&#x201d; the Emperor suggested.</p><p><br>&#x201c;No I wasn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Timotheo protested. &#x201c;I just didn&#x2019;t like not knowing who I am. I think I have the right to know that.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;You have no right. You are convicted of treason to the throne out of your own mouth,&#x201d; the Emperor said, satisfied. He looked at me on my high, uncomfortable bench. &#x201c;The law is the law,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Bear witness, Magid, that this man broke our Imperial decree.&#x201d;</p><p><br>I bowed. I couldn&#x2019;t bear to speak to him.</p><p><br>After that there was a great deal of palaver, with other dignitaries getting up in their grand silks and bearing witness too. It got like a pompous dance. I sat there considering when would be the best time to spirit young Timotheo away&#x2014;and I blame my jet-lagged state that I didn&#x2019;t do it there and then. He was looking stunned by this time. Six men had just paraded past him, passing sentence of death on him, each swinging the white lining of their bright pink cloaks towards him. It was like being sentenced by a bed of petunias. I couldn&#x2019;t take it seriously. I reckoned the best time to act was when they marched Timotheo back to his condemned cell. He had been brought in by a squad of �lite guards with a mage following for added assurance, and I assumed they would think no one could touch him through all that. I bided my time.</p><p><br>And missed out completely. The petunias retired. The Emperor said, quite casually, &#x201c;The sentence can be carried out now.&#x201d; He raised a hand glittering with rings. One of them must have been one of their beam weapons, miniaturized. Timotheo gasped quietly and fell over sideways on the floor with blood running out of his mouth.</p><p><br>It happened so quickly that I hoped it was a trick. I could not believe that, even in the Koryfonic Empire, an Emperor would not want his eldest son alive. While I was climbing down the varnished wooden steps to the centre of the court, I was still sure it was just a deception, to make the Emperor&#x2019;s enemies believe Timotheo was dead. But it was no trick. I touched Timotheo. He was still warm like a living person, but my fingers told me there was no soul there.</p><p><br>I left at once, from beside the corpse, to make my feelings plain.</p><p><br>I was thoroughly disgusted, with myself as well as the Emperor. As I made my way home, I told myself I had been stupid to expect compassion or even value for life in that place. And I had sufficient time to curse myself. Earth lies Naywards of the Empire, which makes the journey rather like going slowly uphill. I had to haul myself from lattice to lattice in the spaces between the worlds, and by the time I reached my house I not only hated the Empire, but also the stupid hampering robes it caused me to wear. I was just tearing the darn things off in my living room when the phone rang.</p><p><br>I wanted nothing more than to sit down with a fresh-brewed cup of coffee, before calling up the Senior Magid and lodging a formal complaint against the Emperor. I swore. I snatched up the phone.</p><p><br>&#x201c;<i>Now</i> what?&#x201d;</p><p><br>It was my elder brother Will &#x201c;Bad day?&#x201d; he said.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Very,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The Koryfonic Empire.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;Then I believe you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Glad I don&#x2019;t have to look after that lot any longer.&#x201d; Will is a Magid too. &#x201c;And what I&#x2019;ve got to tell you won&#x2019;t make your day any better, I&#x2019;m afraid. I&#x2019;m ringing from Stan Churning&#x2019;s house. He&#x2019;s ill. He wants you here.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;Oh God!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Why does everything unpleasant always happen at once?&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know. It just does,&#x201d; Will agreed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a deep secret, but it ought to be. I think Stan&#x2019;s dying, Rupert. He thinks so anyway; We tried to get hold of Si too, but he&#x2019;s out of touch. How soon can you get here?&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;Half an hour,&#x201d; I said. Stan lives outside Newmarket. Weavers End, where I live, is just beyond Cambridge.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said Will. &#x201c;Then I can stay with him until you get here.&#x201d; And keep him alive if necessary, Will meant. If Stan really was dying, there would be Magid business he had to hand on to me. &#x201c;See you soon,&#x201d; Will said and rang off.</p><p><br>I stayed in the house just long enough to make coffee and fax Senior Magid that I intended to complain about the Empire, to the Upper Room if necessary. Senior Magid lives several worlds Naywards and I normally make heavy weather of getting a fax through there. That day I did it in seconds. Five angry, trenchant sentences in no time at all. I was too busy thinking of Stan. I got in my car still thinking of him. Normally, getting into my car is a thing I pause and take pleasure in&#x2014;particularly if I have just been away for a while. It is a wholly beautiful car, the car I used to dream of owning as a boy. I usually pause to think how good it is that I can make the kind of money you need to own such a car. Not that day. I just got in and drove, swigging coffee from the Thermos, with my mind on Stan.</p><p><br>Stan had sponsored first Will, then our brother Simon, then me, into the Company of Magids. He had taught me most of what I know today. I wasn&#x2019;t sure that I knew what I&#x2019;d do without him. I kept praying that he, or Will, had made a mistake and that he was not dying after all. But one of the things about being a Magid is that you don&#x2019;t make that kind of mistake.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Damn!&#x201d; I said. I kept needing to blink. I didn&#x2019;t consciously see any of the roads I drove along until I was bumping up the weedy drive of Stan&#x2019;s bungalow.</p><p><br>A nasty bungalow. A blot on the landscape. It looked like a large cube of Stilton cheese dumped down in the flat heathland. We used to kid Stan about how ugly it was, but he always said he was quite happy in it. People who knew me, and particularly people who knew all three of us Venables brothers when we lived in Cambridge, used to wonder what we saw in a seedy little ex-jockey like Stan. They asked how we could bring ourselves to haunt his hideous house the way we did.</p><p><br>The answer is that all Magids lead double lives. We have to earn a living. Stan earned his advising sheiks and other rich men about racehorses. I design computer software myself, games mostly.</p><p><br>I parked my car beside Will&#x2019;s vehicle. At dusk, with the light behind it, it passes for a Land Rover. In broad daylight, as it was then, you look away and think you may have imagined things. I edged past it and Will opened the bottle-green front door of the bungalow to me.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Good timing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I have to go now and milk the goats. He&#x2019;s in the front room on the left.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;Is he&#x2014;?&#x201d; I said.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Will. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve said goodbye. Shame Si can&#x2019;t be found. He&#x2019;s somewhere yonks Ayewards and not in touch with anyone I can contact. Stan&#x2019;s written him a letter. Let me know how things go, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; He went soberly past me and climbed into his queer vehicle.<br>I went on into the bungalow. Stan was lying, all five foot of him, stretched on top of a narrow bed by the window. His slightly bandy legs were in child-sized jeans and one of his socks had a thin place at the toe. At first sight, you would not have thought there was too much wrong with him, except that it was unlike him not to be wandering about doing something. But if you looked at his face, as I did almost straight away, you saw that it was strangely stretched over its bones, and that his eyes, under the high forehead left by his curly grey receding hair, were standing out like a cat&#x2019;s, luminous and feverish.</p><p><br>&#x201c;What kept you, Rupert?&#x201d; he joked, a bit gaspily. &#x201c;Will phoned you a good five minutes ago.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;The Koryfonic Empire,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I had to send a complaint to Senior Magid.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;That lot!&#x201d; Stan gasped. &#x201c;She gets complaints about them from every Magid who goes near the place. Abuse of power. Contravention of human rights. Manipulation of Magids. General rottenness. I always think she just puts them in a file labelled k.e. and then loses the file.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can...</p></p><h2>Tayos Gold : The Archives of Atlantis</h2><p>In 1976, Scottish engineer Stan Hall organized a landmark expedition to the caves of the Tayos Indians in Ecuador, involving a dozen institutions, joint Special Forces and astronaut professor Neil Armstrong as Honorary President and participant. Hall was driven by curiosity about Erich von D�niken's report of a Metal Library allegedly found in the caves by investigator Juan Moricz in the mid-1960s (published in von D�niken's 1972 blockbuster Gold of the Gods). The story was considered unacceptable within an orthodox view of global history, especially in the absence of any ancient written script in South America. On this expedition, Hall began a personal odyssey into the heart of global enigmas: the origins of mankind, Atlantis, Ptolemy's lost city of Cattigara, and the sudden rise and fall of wonder civilizations... a journey that ended with his identification of Atlantis and Cattigara, and the entrance to the Metal Library along the Pastaza River in Ecuador. Chapters include: Juan Moricz-Magyar Extraordinary; Egyptian Tablets of the Mormons; Ecuador: Cradle of Civilization; The Triangle of the Shell, Tunnels Below the Andes; Discovery in the Caves; Neil Armstrong: Second Small Step; Into the Tayos Caves; Treasure of the Incas; Explorers Percy Fawcett and George M. Dyott; Valverde&#x2019;s Treasure; Tayos Treasure: Analysis and Location; more.</p><p>Born in Edinburgh, raised in nearby Dunbar, birthplace of conservationist John Muir. In 1973, initiated the first survey of the Callanish Stone Circles in Scotland, following in 1976 with a landmark scientific expedition to the Tayos Caves of Ecuador, of which astronaut-professor Neil Armstrong was Honorary President and participant. Discovered the only authenticated natural diamond ever found in Ecuador and asserts El Dorado was clandestinely mined by the Spaniards until the Jivaro-Shuar rebellion of 1599... also that Chan Chan in Peru and Teotihuacan in Mexico are the sites of Claudius Ptolemy&#39;s lost cities of Cattigara and Acadthra. In 1993, initiated project Tayu Waa targeting World Heritage status for 100,000Km2 of traditional Shuar-Achuar territory in Upper Amazonia, for which efforts he was nominated for an Ecuadorian Blue Planet Award and elected International Representative and Honorary Brother for life of the Federation Shuar. In 1998, rescued thousands of Ecuadorian artifacts representative of the formative cultures of the Americas, asserting these cultures originated in the coastal regions of Ecuador.</p><h2>Witchfinders: A Seventeenth-Century English Tragedy</h2><p><p>By spring 1645, two years of civil war had exacted a dreadful toll upon England. People lived in terror as disease and poverty spread, and the nation grew ever more politically divided. In a remote corner of Essex, two obscure gentlemen, Matthew Hopkins and John Stearne, exploited the anxiety and lawlessness of the time and initiated a brutal campaign to drive out the presumed evil in their midst. Touring Suffolk and East Anglia on horseback, they detected demons and idolators everywhere. Through torture, they extracted from terrified prisoners confessions of consorting with Satan and demonic spirits.</p><p>Acclaimed historian Malcolm Gaskill retells the chilling story of the most savage witch-hunt in English history. By the autumn of 1647 at least 250 people--mostly women--had been captured, interrogated, and hauled before the courts. More than a hundred were hanged, causing Hopkins to be dubbed "Witchfinder General" by critics and admirers alike. Though their campaign was never legally sanctioned, they garnered the popular support of local gentry, clergy, and villagers. While <i>Witchfinders</i> tells of a unique and tragic historical moment fueled by religious fervor, today it serves as a reminder of the power of fear and fanaticism to fuel ordinary people's willingness to demonize others.</p></p><p>Malcolm Gaskill is a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, where he is Director of Studies in History.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/GASWIT_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>The Rifles: Volume Six of Seven Dreams: A Book of North American Landscapes</h2><p><b>The story of John Franklin&#x2019;s doomed 1845 attempt to discover a Northwest Passage, from the National Book Award-winning author of <i>Europe Central</i></b><br><br>Vaulting through time to another flashpoint in the long struggle between Indians and Europeans, William T. Vollmann's visionary fictional history now focuses on the white explorers of the mid-1800s, desperately dreaming of forging a Northwest Passage. As Sir John Franklin embarks on his fourth Arctic voyage, he defies the warnings of the native people, and his journey ends in ice and death. But his spirit lingers in the Canadian north, where 150 years later, in 1990, Inuit elders dream of long-gone seal-hunting days and teenagers sniff gasoline. And when a white man seduces and leaves pregnant a young Indian woman, he becomes Franklin reincarnated, bound for the same fate. Vollmann's vivid characters and landscapes weave together the stories of the past and present to live out America's ongoing tragedy of greed, ignorance, and violence.</p><p>William T. Vollmann is the author of ten novels, including <i>Europe Central</i>, which won the National Book Award.&nbsp; He has also written four collections of stories, including <i>The</i> <i>Atlas</i>, which won the PEN Center USA West Award for Fiction, a memoir, and six works of nonfiction, including <i>Rising Up and Rising Down</i> and <i>Imperial</i>, both of which were finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award. He is the recipient of a Whiting Writers Award and the Strauss Living Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.&nbsp; His journalism and fiction have been published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Harpers</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Granta</i>, and many other publications.Volume Six of Vollmann's vast, timeless epic Seven Dreams, this third novel (after Fathers and Crows, 1992) in the series takes up as its primary theme the lost 1845 expedition of Sir John Franklin to the Arctic in search of the Northwest Passage. As with any of this yarnspinner's weavings, however, temporal boundaries have been overcome; along with a close account of Franklin and his command suffering through several winters in the frozen North, slowly and painfully poisoned by lead in their canned provisions and finally locked in ice so that they had to abandon their ships and starve on a hopeless trek to civilization, are tales of forced Inuit relocations in the 1950's and the historical erosion of Inuit culture--starting with the introduction of rifles by early explorers and ending with rampant gasoline sniffing and other abuses in substandard settlements provided by the Canadian government. Through his own liaison, Captain Subzero, a modern-day reincarnation of Franklin, becomes linked with the ghost of the explorer's Inuit mistress from an earlier expedition--a bond that gives him license to view Franklin's ill-fated journey firsthand. Subzero exists in another form as well, as the author's alter-ego, and part of the chronicle involves a harrowing description of Vollmann's 12 days on ice, at an abandoned weather station far north of the Arctic Circle, where poor judgment and inferior equipment nearly brought him to a literal reenactment of Franklin's fate. Bleak icy vistas vie with evidence of human desolation at every turn in this restless, chilling saga--less monumental than its predecessors, perhaps, but every bit as challenging. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He was nicely dressed in khakis and a blue polo shirt. Only the scar on his cheek kept him from looking distinguished. Instead it made him look rakish &#x2013; like a James Bond wannabe who might be a good guy to have on your side in a bar fight. And he was smiling widely enough to display canine teeth, which gave him a wolfish look.<br><br>A blue Ford pickup truck was parked behind him in our sandy lane. It was pointed toward Lake Shore Drive, which showed he&#x2019;d come around from Eighty-eighth Street, driving into our semirural neighborhood by the back road and coming past our neighbor&#x2019;s house. Despite this hint that he knew the territory, the man had proved he was a stranger by coming to the front door; all our friends and relations come in through the kitchen.<br><br>He showed up around eleven o&#x2019;clock on a miserably hot Monday in the second week of July. I wasn&#x2019;t at all happy to hear a knock. For once our five house-guests were all occupied elsewhere at the same time, and I wasn&#x2019;t due at TenHuis Chocolade &#x2013; where a major chocolate crisis was underway &#x2013; until one. I had been enjoying having a moment alone.<br><br>I peeked through the screen door cautiously. We rarely get salesmen, but I didn&#x2019;t know of anyone else who might come by without phoning ahead. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>The man&#x2019;s grin seemed familiar, though I was sure I didn&#x2019;t know him. &#x201c;Hi. Are you Mrs. Woodyard? Mrs. Joe Woodyard?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I answered confidently, though I&#x2019;d had that title for less than three months.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose your husband is home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I expect him shortly.&#x201d; By that I meant in an hour, but I wasn&#x2019;t going to tell a stranger too much.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh? Should I wait? Or I can come back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is schedule is indelicate.&#x201d; Yikes! I&#x2019;d twisted my tongue in a knot. As usual. &#x201c;I mean indefinite!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;His schedule is indefinite. Can I give him a message?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well...&#x201d; The stranger sighed deeply, then smiled again, showing those wolfish eyeteeth. &#x201c;I guess you could tell him his father came by,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>I remember staring at him for at least thirty seconds before I answered.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell him,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>Then I slammed the door. The real, solid door, not the screen door. And I turned the dead bolt above the handle.<br><br>I moved away from the door, but the man on the porch was still clearly visible through the window. I knew he could see me too, if he glanced inside. I didn&#x2019;t like that idea, so I went around the fireplace and stood at the bottom of the stairs. This seemed more subtle than slamming our antique casement window shut and yanking the curtains closed.<br><br>Now the stranger couldn&#x2019;t see me lurking behind the fireplace, but I couldn&#x2019;t see him either. And I found that I wanted to keep an eye on him. Where could I hide and watch him?<br><br>Hide? Why did I have the impulse to hide? The idea was absurd. Why should the idea of someone claiming to be Joe&#x2019;s father make me look for a closet do duck into?<br><br>So I moved out into the living room. I didn&#x2019;t hide, but I did stay near the fireplace, away from the windows, where a person walking casually through the yard wouldn&#x2019;t be able to easily see me. If the man looked in through a window, I decided, I&#x2019;d call the police.<br><br>Of course, if he wanted to get into the house, I had no way of stopping him short of hitting him with the fireplace poker. I had locked the front door, but our house &#x2013; built in 1904 &#x2013; has no air conditioning. With the temperature and the humidity both in the nineties, all the windows and doors were open. I might lock the front door, but an intruder could come in any other door or any window without trouble.<br><br>The man didn&#x2019;t look into the house. I heard his footsteps leaving the porch, and I heard the door of the pickup open. He was going away. I wondered what Joe would make of the visit when I told him about it.<br><br>He might know who the man was, I realized. He might even want to contact the guy.<br><br>I grabbed a pen and a piece of junk mail that happened to be lying on the coffee table, rushed to the front door, unlocked it, and ran outside. The truck was just pulling away, and I waved the man down. He opened the right-hand window and leaned across the truck&#x2019;s seat.<br><br>I tried to keep my voice noncommittal. &#x201c;Can you leave a phone number?&#x201d;<br><br>A faint smile crossed the man&#x2019;s face. Again, he seemed familiar, and suddenly I knew why. That grin &#x2013; the corners of his mouth went up just like Joe&#x2019;s. And his eyes were the same bright blue.<br><br>I caught my breath, but didn&#x2019;t speak.<br><br>The stranger put the truck in gear. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure where I&#x2019;ll be,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call later.&#x201d;<br><br>He drove away, and I stood there gaping after him.<br><br>He simply couldn&#x2019;t be Joe&#x2019;s dad.<br><br>Only a few weeks earlier, I had laid a wreath of plastic carnations on Andrew Joseph Woodyard&#x2019;s grave.

Dedan Kimathi became President of Mau Mau&#x2019;s ruling body in August 1953 and remained its overall head until his capture and death two years later.

How are the senses used in communicating cultural knowledge? In Sensational Knowledge, ethnomusicologist and dancer Tomie Hahn uncovers the process and nuances of learning nihon buyo, a traditional Japanese dance form. She uses case studies of dancers at all levels, as well as her own firsthand experiences, to investigate the complex language of bodies, especially across cultural divides. Paying particular attention to the effect of body-to-body transmission, and how culturally constructed processes of transmission influence our sense of self, Hahn argues that the senses facilitate the construction of &#34;boundaries of existence&#34; that define our physical and social worlds. In this flowing and personal text, Hahn reveals the ways in which culture shapes our attendance to various sensoria, and how our interpretation of sensory information shapes our individual realities. An included DVD provides visual examples.</p><p>TOMIE HAHN is an associate professor in the department of the arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. A performer and student of Japanese dance since the age of four, she has been awarded natori&#x2015; the professional stage title of Samie Tachibana&#x2015;from the Tachibana School in Tokyo."Hahn's focus on the body and somatic knowledge opens up the world of Japanese dance in utterly new ways. The poetry of her writing highlights the dynamic links between sensual experience and ethnographic practice."&#x2015;Deborah Wong, author of Speak It Louder: Asian Americans Making Music<br><br>"As the Western scholarly literature on Japanese arts continues to burgeon, Tomie Hahn's reflexive approach to transmission is both significant and needed. She offers a window into an important means of communicating culture."&#x2015;Bonnie Wade, professor of music, University of California at Berkeley</p><h2>The Physics of Life: The Evolution of Everything</h2><p><p><i>The Physics of Life</i> explores the roots of the big question by examining the deepest urges and properties of living things, both animate and inanimate: how to live longer, with food, warmth, power, movement and free access to other people and surroundings. Bejan explores controversial and relevant issues such as sustainability, water and food supply, fuel, and economy, to critique the state in which the world understands positions of power and freedom. Breaking down concepts such as desire and power, sports health and culture, the state of economy, water and energy, politics and distribution, Bejan uses the language of physics to explain how each system works in order to clarify the meaning of evolution in its broadest scientific sense, moving the reader towards a better understanding of the world's systems and the natural evolution of cultural and political development. </p><p><i>The Physics of Life </i>argues that the evolution phenomenon is much broader and older than the evolutionary designs that constitute the biosphere, empowering readers with a new view of the globe and the future, revealing that the urge to have better ideas has the same physical effect as the urge to have better laws and better government. This is evolution explained loudly but also elegantly, forging a path that flows sustainability.</p></p><p><b>Adrian Bejan</b>, chair professor of Mechanical Engineering at Duke University, is one of the world's preeminent energy scientists who developed the Constructal Law of design and evolution in nature. He also currently holds chairs at the University of Evora, University of Pretoria, and Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He has written leading books on applied physics, including <i>Design in Nature,</i> <i>Advanced Engineering Thermodynamics, Convection Heat Transfer, </i>and <i>Convection in Porous Media</i>. He has given two TED lectures.<p>"Bejan isn&#x2019;t the first person to study behavior as physics, or to use physics to describe wider systems. But his new book, <i>The Physics of Life: The Evolution of Everything</i>, may be the broadest consideration yet. Harking back to the original definition of the discipline&#x2015;'knowledge of nature' in Greek&#x2015;he ultimately concludes that 'life and evolution <i>are</i> physics.'" &#x2015;<i>National Geographic</i></p><p>"Riveting and poetic...Renowned energy scientist Bejan...elegantly argues that evolution transcends the boundaries of the biological and governs the flow of all phenomena...Unique and entirely fascinating, this book will linger in your consciousness and prompt you to look at the world with fresh eyes." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (Starred)</p><p>"In this quirky, occasionally ingenious work, Bejan explores evolution as a phenomenon not of biology but of physics." &#x2015;<i>Publisher's Weekly</i></p><p>"Bejan&#x2019;s book and the theory that it expounds, I believe, would soon establish a new paradigm for biology, sociology, and human and cultural studies. Just as the laws of physics created a unifying vision of the universe and lead to a continuous development of technology, so will this breakthrough concept for these fields. With its depth and breadth, this book seized my attention, took hold of my imagination and resolved many design questions my field faces. Finally, 'design' can be grounded in theory, not simply observation and intuitive groping for answers; a theory that has explanatory and predictive power. In this sense, absorbing the book&#x2019;s message becomes a liberating experience; it removes doubt and uncertainty from routine practical efforts. And with this certainty, comes a hopeful message amidst voices of gloom: the future is constructive, open-ended and full of promise.

When an army of bandits descends on them, the Amish are saved by the last-minute arrival of government troops. But they soon learn that soldiers can be as cruel as the bandits themselves. Then a bishop travels to Mexico, and Caleb's daughters are finally able to marry, though the ban still looms for Miriam even as her beloved Domingo decides he must go off to fight in the coming war. As Caleb's frail hope of peace and freedom in Mexico slips away, he is left to ponder the question: In times of trouble, on whom should we rely?</p><p>Inspired by Actual Events!<br><br><i>"I want you to promise you will always be my sister."<br><br>There were tears in Miriam's eyes as their foreheads touched and Rachel whispered, "No matter what.

In <em>The Herbal Kitchen</em>, IACP award-winning cookbook author and acclaimed Herbfarm Restaurant chef Jerry Traunfeld presents simple dishes using herbs straight from the market, windowsill, or garden.</p><p>Until recently, the fresh herbs available in supermarkets were limited to parsley and maybe dill. Today, thyme, rosemary, basil, cilantro, mint, and sage are among the many fresh herbs as close as the produce section or the farmer's market. Not to mention marjoram, lovage, tarragon, lavender, shiso, and so many others.</p><p>Jerry shows you how to incorporate these fresh herbs into your everyday home meals. So whether preparing a workday supper for the family, a special dinner for two or four, or a feast for a table of guests, using fresh herbs in your cooking will result in fresh and vibrant food.</p><p><em>The Herbal Kitchen</em> includes some recipes that are home variations of the innovative dishes Jerry prepares at the Herbfarm, while others are fresh takes on familiar classics such as Herb Garden Lasagna or Shrimp in Garlic-Sage Butter. All are uncomplicated and prep time is minimal -- with the emphasis on spontaneity and the unmistakable flavors of fresh herbs.</p><p>Start off with Asparagus and Lemon Thyme Soup, Spicy Verbena Meatballs, or Rye-Thyme Cheese Straws before moving on to Cinnamon Basil Chicken, Side of Salmon Slow-Roasted in Dill, and Root Ribbons with Sage. Delectable desserts include Warm Lavender Almond Cakes, Rhubarb Mint Cobbler, and a sinful Chocolate Peppermint Tart.</p><p>Once you're hooked on cooking with fresh herbs, you'll want to grow them yourself. <em>The Herbal Kitchen</em> is filled with important tips for growing, harvesting, and handling each of the herbs used in the recipes. Valuable information on the varieties of each herb is also highlighted, such as how to tell the difference between Greek oregano and Italian oregano, why you always want to choose bay laurel over California bay, and what type of lavender is best for cooking.</p><p>Filled with stunning photos of the herbs, the techniques for handling them, and the finished dishes, Jerry's definitive guide is sure to be a classic, reached for again and again.</p></p><p>There are herb gardens, and then there's the Herbfarm, both an award-winning restaurant with an award winning chef, Jerry Traunfeld, and an herb farm--literally. Over the past 14-years Traunfeld has had a farm's worth of herbs to work with in his commercial kitchen and at home. He opened the doors to his commercial kitchen with <i>The Herbfarm Cookbook</i>. And now he takes us home with <i>The Herbal Kitchen</i>. Here's a hint: It's all about heightened flavor through the creative use of herbs. <p> There's the humble roasted oyster, for example. Traunfeld makes a sauce of fresh sorrel, butter, shallots, cream, and lemon juice. Each oyster sits in its half shell atop a dollop of the sauce and bakes until plump. They are served topped with fine strips of fresh sorrel. Briny oyster meets tart sorrel gentled with cream and butter. Does it get any better? You bet it does. Roasted Oysters with Sorrel Sauce is but an appetizer, along with Minted Lentil and Goat Cheese Strudel, and Spicy Verbena Meatballs. </p><p> After a brief introduction to herb basics, Traunfeld moves on to appetizers and drinks (the Rosemary Gin and Tonic sounds intriguing). Chapters that follow cover soups, salads, fast suppers, meals for a crowd, intimate feasts, vegetable dishes, breads, and desserts. Consider the Shiso Crab Cocktail, or Black Olive Roast Chicken, Sides of Salmon Slow-Roasted in Dill, or Lavender-Rubbed Duck Breasts with Apricots and Sweet Onions. </p><p> These are precise, carefully thought-out and executed recipes, and they are all built around the masterful use of fresh herbs. You will want to attend to your gardening as much as your cooking with this book as inspiration. Work through <i>The Herbal Kitchen</i> from front to back and you will transform your relationship with herbs. The food you cook and eat will never be the same. And that's a delicious gift from one of the mighty. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p><p>Since 1990 Jerry Traunfeld has headed the kitchen at The Herbfarm Restaurant, where he creates herb-inspired Northwest menus each week. Since he took over the stoves, the restaurant has garnered unanimous national acclaim as a premier dining destination. In 2000, Jerry won the James Beard Award for Best American Chef in the Northwest and Hawaii. His first book, <strong>The Herbfarm Cookbook</strong>, won the 2000 IACP award for best cookbook by a restaurant or chef.

Using a series of linked narratives, <i>Trying Home </i>reveals the stories of the iconoclastic individuals who lived in Home, among them Lois Waisbrooker, an advocate of women&#x2019;s rights and free love, who was arrested for her writings after the assassination of President McKinley; Jay Fox, editor of The Agitator, who defended his right to free speech all the way to the Supreme Court; and Donald Vose, a young man who grew up in Home and turned spy for a detective agency.</p><p> Justin Wadland weaves his own discovery of Home&#x2015;and his own reflections on the concept of home&#x2015;into the story, setting the book apart from a conventional history. After discovering the newspapers published in the colony, Wadland ventures beyond the documents to explore the landscape, travelling by boat along the steamer route most visitors once took to the settlement. He visits Home to talk with people who live there now.</p><p> Meticulously researched and engagingly written, Trying Home will fascinate scholars and general readers alike, especially those interested in the history of the Pacific Northwest, utopian communities, and anarchism.</p></p><p>Justin Wadland works as a librarian at the University of Washington Tacoma Library.

Though billed as a novel, <i>Fencing the Sky</i> is in fact a more deeply fictionalized continuation of <i>The Meadow</i>, Galvin's partly historic, partly imagined evocation of a way of life that took hold on an upland Wyoming ranch for a century and then blew away.<p> If <i>The Meadow</i> is elegiac, <i>Fencing the Sky</i> is angry and blackly humorous. This is the grim, greedy '90s, when swaggering developers like Merriwether Snipes ride the range in their ATV's, carving up the old homesteads into 40-acre ranchettes and making life hell for the few decent people who remain. Galvin makes three of these holdouts his heroes--Oscar Rose, who supports a cattle habit (and family) by working as a vet; Adkisson Trent, a doctor who inherited from his father a spectacular spread and a penchant for proud solitude; and Arans, the renegade, who fled from New Jersey to become a cowboy. The heat of the book rises from the connections and passions of these men--their women and work troubles, their unspoken bond with each other, their fury at Snipes and everything he represents.</p><p> Galvin, a poet, has assembled his narrative out of vivid shards, yet, despite the jump-cuts, this is an old-fashioned novel at heart, with heroes and villains, heartbreak and suspense, and characters so real you want to ride out and shake hands. The same themes, the same imagery, the same equine adoration crop up in Cormac McCarthy and Larry McMurtry, but Galvin has a lighter touch, eschewing myth for the minute particulars of hard work and hard luck in a single community. Galvin can also crack a good joke, even though he knows as well as anyone that there's not a lot to laugh about under the big sky these days. <i>--David Laskin</i></p><p>A beloved poet, celebrated nonfiction writer and now novelist, <b>James Galvin </b>is the author of <i>The Meadow</i>.

They contain detailed teachings on Meditiation, Initiation and the Six Stages of Discipleship. They emphasise the new age, pioneering necessity for group work, the development of group consciousness, and the change in training for initiation from individuals to discipleship groups.<br><br> While the original intention behind the group working instructions contained in Volume I, was to externalise eventually through groups of nine integrated disciples, the work of nine subjectively organised groups (hence the name "Groups of Nine" given to this work), this second volume contains the teaching given between the years 1940 and 1949 after the group had been reduced and reorganised into one group, "the new seed group". <br><br>One of the main objectives of the new seed group was to "anchor" some of the principles and seed ideas for the new civilisation of the Aquarian era; and also to create an integrated group of trained Hierarchical workers capable of providing needed cooperation with activities initiated by Hierarchy to fertalise and prepare human consciousness for the tremendous stimulation of the immediate future. In this book, therefore, the personal instructions cover a shorter period of time and only 22 individuals.<br><br>Two vitally important aspects of the life of discipleship are emphasised from the standpoint of practical training techniques--meditation and initiation. Meditation is shown not only as a way of approach by the individual to the soul, and by the group to the Master, but as the creative technique of the Lord of the World by which all is brought into being. All centres of consciousness in the planet, large and small, can employ the same meditative techniques to create the new and needed forms consistent with the changing emphasis of energy flow and divine purpose. Meditation thus becomes an act of conscious cooperation with "the strictly redemptive purposes" of our planetary life. <br><br>The teachings on initiation are also given an essentially practical presentation as "facts of life", to be understood and applied. The glamourous idea of initiation as a reward for a good, self-disciplined way of life, dissipates in the light of the reality. Neither has initiation for the disciple anything to do with the internal, organisational "initiations" peculiar to many occult orders and groups, which are meaningless except in the context of the organisation itself. <br><br>Initiation for the disciple is the result of a conscious expansion into "larger and larger wholes"--a progressive expansion into the actual stream of consciousness of our planetary Life. These expansions in consciousness are accompanied by a succession of revelations; and in this volume of "Discipleship in the New Age", five points of revelation are discussed, with hints and symbolic formulas leading to a correct interpretation of them. <br><br>A disciple is "one who knows"; he has learned through personal experience that spiritual law and principle applied in service, create a condition of balance in which relationship is restored between the Way of God and the ways of men. Through that point of fusion light can radiate for the benefit of those who stumble in the dark. True revelation is a shared experience.</p><p>Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master, and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching for the present and the immediate future. Alice Bailey established the Lucis Publishing Company to provide a vehicle for publishing the books that she wrote, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world. Mrs. Bailey&#39;s books have been in constant distributution for over 75 years. Therefore, her work continues to the present day.</p><h2>The Holy Kojiki -- Including, The Yengishiki</h2><p>Also known as the &#34;Records of Ancient Matters,&#34; this is the &#34;official&#34; story of the Japanese peoples, first written down in the 8th century and documenting the creation of the world, the gods, and Japan.

In "Empire of Enchantment," Gollie is certain that queenly blood flows through her veins when she finds a picture of a regal aunt. She drives Bink crazy with all her airs. She sweeps through the streets complimenting the townsfolk on "their efforts on behalf of the empire." When it starts to rain, Gollie's snooty demeanor falters, and she's back to her old self. In the second story, Bink decides to get a Stretch-O-Matic since she is sick of being short and is sure that this device will do the trick. She is suspended from the ceiling in the complicated contraption when flabbergasted Gollie walks in. The whole thing comes crashing down, but Bink comes up with a creative way to fix the machine and feel tall at the same time. In "Kudos, Bink and Gollie," the friends decide to become famous by appearing in Flicker's Arcana of the Extraordinary, a Guinness Book of World Records-type compilation. Figuring that some sort of collection will land them in the book, they head off to Eccles' Empire of Enchantment. They buy 100 packages of 66 gold stickers each that they are sure is their ticket to fame. The plan doesn't pan out, but the clever duo comes up with a face-saving solution. The first story would make a fun read-aloud, as it lends itself to using alternately haughty and exasperated voices. All three stories feature Fucile's expressive and attitude-filled line drawings.

Around the turn of the twentieth century, music entrepreneurs laid the foundation for today&#x2019;s vast industry, with new products, technologies, and commercial strategies to incorporate music into the daily rhythm of modern life. Popular songs filled the air with a new kind of musical pleasure, phonographs brought opera into the parlor, and celebrity performers like Enrico Caruso captivated the imagination of consumers from coast to coast. </p><p><i>Selling Sounds</i> uncovers the origins of the culture industry in music and chronicles how music ignited an auditory explosion that penetrated all aspects of society. It maps the growth of the music business across the social landscape&#x2015;in homes, theaters, department stores, schools&#x2015;and analyzes the effect of this development on everything from copyright law to the sensory environment. While music came to resemble other consumer goods, its distinct properties as sound ensured that its commercial growth and social impact would remain unique. </p><p>Today, the music that surrounds us&#x2015;from iPods to ring tones to Muzak&#x2015;accompanies us everywhere from airports to grocery stores. The roots of this modern culture lie in the business of popular song, player-pianos, and phonographs of a century ago. Provocative, original, and lucidly written, <i>Selling Sounds</i> reveals the commercial architecture of America&#x2019;s musical life.</p></p><p>David Suisman is Associate Professor of History at the University of Delaware.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Mark Athitakis The music industry is supposedly dying, but it's not going away quietly. A contentious debate this year over online radio royalties turned on who gets paid what in the pop economy. Congressional hearings on a proposed merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster delved into whether one company would monopolize a corner of the concert business. Michael Jackson's death not only prompted a massive sales boost for his recordings but also brought a rare moment of agreement between fans and critics on the musical icon's legacy. As four new books make clear, these stories are just the latest iterations of decades-long arguments over how music gets played, heard, admired and paid for. The music industry was a dirty business long ago, as David Suisman explains in "Selling Sounds," his meticulously researched history of its early days. In the 1890s Charles K. Harris brazenly boosted sheet-music sales of his song "After the Ball" by paying singers as much as $50 a week to perform it. By the 20th century, publishers were planting boosters in the audiences of vaudeville shows to stand up and applaud new songs, while hired "pluggers" pushed songs at parks, ballgames, dances and at least one nudist resort. By 1914, music publishers were spending so much money paying off their hires that they agreed to ban the fakery. Then they ignored their own ban. Suisman's book isn't strictly an expos� of old-time payola. It traces how quickly commerce took shape in the music business. The Copyright Act made music more potentially profitable, and recording companies fought for their share of Americans' entertainment dollars. The Victor Talking Machine Company became a leader thanks to the star power of tenor Enrico Caruso. But no less important, it did so by making home listening feel natural to skeptical consumers. It was no accident, Suisman notes, that Victor used a cute dog as a mascot, driving home the idea that newfangled phonographs were domesticated creatures, "trained, groomed, and well-behaved." Copyright law and phonographs, Suisman argues, transformed the musical landscape, making it easier to sell brief pop songs instead of narrative ballads, new songs instead of traditionals, catchiness instead of thought. Failure awaited those who ignored the rules. Suisman tells the story of Black Swan, the first major black-owned record label, which was launched in 1921 and sold spirituals, opera and songs promoting African American uplift. But the label was dead by 1923, largely because it couldn't compete with the hot jazz and blues songs the larger labels were selling and with the popular stereotypes those labels were using to promote them. In "How the Beatles Destroyed Rock 'n' Roll," Elijah Wald constructs a history of pop that challenges received wisdom. He resists the bomb-throwing tone of the title and, like many scholars, routinely qualifies his assertions. But his version of history is provocative in several ways. For one, he gives more importance to bandleaders like Paul Whiteman; instead of blasting him for softening jazz with orchestral arrangements, as many critics have, Wald argues that Whiteman broadened jazz's possibilities by forcing other bandleaders to innovate. And though Wald doesn't exactly embrace post-World War II curiosities such as exotica and calypso, he respects the commingling of the musical forces they represented. Wald asserts that pop reached its high point in 1964, when genres were so well integrated musically and racially that Billboard briefly stopped keeping separate R&amp;B and pop charts. And what was so awful about the Beatles? In the closing pages, Wald asserts that their later albums were so influential in defining rock's boundaries that they drove a lasting wedge between black and white pop. The Beatles "were the catalysts for a divide between rock and soul that, rather than being mended in later years, would only grow wider with the emergence of disco and hip-hop." That's a debatable point, and unfortunately he doesn't wrestle much with it, limiting the span of his research to the release of "Sgt. Pepper." His book demands a sequel, "What Happened After the Beatles Destroyed Rock 'n' Roll," that might bring the same intellectual rigor to hip-hop that he uses on the racial politics of cakewalks and swing music. Like Wald's book, Greg Milner's "Perfecting Sound Forever" is sprawling and ambitious, covering the entire history of music recording, from Edison cylinders to ProTools. And it has flaws: Milner's narrative is larded with minutiae, including discussions of magnetic tape, 45s and the drums on Phil Collins's "In the Air Tonight." But when his record geek's affection for rock music is allowed to blossom in the second half of the book, his thesis becomes clearer: In recent years, the desperate need to mint hits has made pop music absurdly overprocessed. Producers today will occasionally broker "shootouts," in which multiple engineers compete to create the "hottest," or loudest-sounding, version of a record. Though the resulting songs blast out of the speakers, they also grate on the ears, even those of fans. Today, Milner writes, "we're surrounded by music that does nothing but shout." But however much knob-twiddling engineers have alienated consumers in recent years, Greg Kot argues, record labels and their litigious associates have done much more harm. In "Ripped," the longtime Chicago Tribune music critic assembles profiles of recent alt-rock causes celebres including Arcade Fire, Girl Talk and Conor Oberst, whose successes were largely sparked online via file-sharing, iTunes and tastemakers such as Pitchfork. For Kot, this is a great moment in pop, both for what you can hear and how you can hear it, and the fun is dampened only by major-label greed and the recording industry's killjoy lawyers. Public Enemy's Chuck D nicely summarizes the point: "Piracy? The biggest pirates have been the record companies." Kot's philosophy is appealingly simple -- anything serving fans and artists is good, anything serving corporate honchos isn't -- though it sometimes seems overly rosy. Discussing Radiohead's pioneering pay-what-you-like concept for its 2007 album, "In Rainbows," Kot congratulates the band for innovating when it could have charged standard retail prices: "Rest assured that most of its fans would gladly pay." But Radiohead also had the cachet to charge nothing for its music and to rest assured that enough paying fans would keep the band solvent; upstart bands lack that luxury, and Kot's discussion of the Internet as an excellent distributor gives short shrift to its failings as a moneymaker. Still, Kot's instincts are on point: His skepticism about the corporate record industry is inspired by recent events, and there are decades of bad behavior to back him up.

Flowers, borders, geometric figures, landscapes, people, and animals, on their own or together, form the backbone of traditional Swedish stranded patterns. With the help of clear diagrams and full-color knitted swatches, a little knitting school, a pattern library, and eyecatching photography, intermediate knitters can confidently try out wrist warmers, hats, and ponchos; and veterans can challenge themselves with sweaters, jackets, and gloves. Pull out your needles, choose your yarns, and get ready to explore the depth, complexity, and beauty of traditional Swedish knitting!</p><p><b>Maja Karlsson</b> lives in the small cozy town of Arvika, Sweden, in a charming house built in the 1920s. At the top is a floral studio where she spends a large part of her day. She is a freelance knitter and designer, writer, blogger, photographer, lecturer, and teacher, and also operates her own online yarn store named Maja Manufaktur.Karlsson, in her first book, follows a tried-and-true format. She features color photographs (sometimes in a gallery, often as accompaniments to design, and occasionally both); full instructions for each pattern; and references. Focusing on two-color stranded knitting, she has adapted classic patterns for today's wearables, from cardigans and pullovers to a dress and winter accessories. Her delight in the art of knitting permeates each page, including personal stories (at six years old, she learned the fundamentals from Grandmother Greta), a few myths (never knit your boyfriend a sweater, since, before it's finished, you'll break up), and introductions to each of the designs. Her Rosa cardigan, for instance, plays on the 1940s fashion for rose panels, while Persian slippers get their pizzazz from streamlined star motifs. The patterns library, pulled from her vintage magazine collection and elsewhere, and the helpful back-of-the-book inclusions (abbreviations, knitting school, yarn sources, and pattern graph template) enable knitters to begin to master what's considered a fairly advanced skill. �<i><b>Booklist</b></i></p><h2>When Misery is Company: End Self-Sabotage and Become Content</h2><p>This book offers solutions to anyone who has felt victimized, ostracized or left behind by life.<br><br>Surprising as it may sound, many people take comfort in their own misery. Feeling too good for too long (or even feeling good at all) can be scary for people, explains Anne Katherine. "Achievement creates anxiety. Intimacy leads to fear. Happiness produces uneasiness. Pleasure causes pain. The solution to this dilemma: what feels good has to be stopped. I call this an addiction to misery." Katherine's fascination and perspective book provides immediate assistance to those people who think they might be making choices that keep them at a "carefully calibrated level of existence--beneath bliss and above despair."</p><p>Anne Katherine, M.A., is a psychotherapist, licensed mental health counselor, and popular author who is known for her pioneering work in developing effective programs for recovery from food addiction and discovery of life purpose.

My new office was finished yesterday, so I moved into it today. It�s really beautiful, with a view of the ships� canal. My new boss likes me a lot. This morning she asked me to join some of the managers at an informal dinner at her home tonight. I accepted and got directions.</p> <p> �I hadn�t eaten breakfast and then I worked through lunch. After work, I went into the ladies� room and looked at myself and I thought, How could anyone believe in me? I�m gross looking. My clothes are all wrong.</p> <p> �So I putzed around, arranging my office, and lost track of the time and left fifteen minutes late. And then I got stuck behind a school bus. So I got to her place thirty minutes late. And then I saw the house she lives in. It�s huge. It�s elegant. What was I doing there?</p> <p> �And all the cars were there already. Nobody was still arriving. I sat outside for an hour and I couldn�t make myself go in. So I finally just left. I went to a restaurant and ate about three meals. Then I came home.</p> <p> �I�m not good enough for this kind of job. I was afraid I would do some stupid thing if I went inside and that everyone would hate me. And that she�d think she made a big mistake hiring me.�</p> <p> I closed my eyes as I heard this because I could see the series of actions and nonactions that became a cascade of self-sabotage for Carrie. I could tell she wasn�t seeing how her failure to show up would come across to her boss. In the state she was in, she couldn�t imagine what would be happening inside the house�her boss and the managers waiting for her, delaying dinner, wondering and worrying, then waiting for an explanatory phone call. She�d gotten lost in a tunnel in her head and saw everything from inside out.</p> <p> At first it seemed to me that the trigger�the first event that started her slide�was seeing herself in the ladies� room mirror. But her anxiety had been brewing before that. Her fancy new office scared her. Her boss�s appreciation scared her. Even her own thoughts scared her�what if she couldn�t measure up? The invitation to be a member of the inner circle may have been the final straw.</p> <p> So much bounty so soon in her new job led her to fear that she might not rise to others� expectations. This fear caused her to see herself as unattractive when she looked in the mirror.</p> <p> Carrie had already put herself in danger of not thinking clearly by skipping breakfast and lunch. Then she made a series of decisions�or, rather, failed to make decisions�that could have led to a better outcome. She putzed instead of thinking about how to get ready, didn�t set an alarm in order to get out of the office on time, and didn�t call a therapy group member to get help with her anxiety and decisions. By not acting in an effective way, she allowed the internal avalanche to build.</p> <p> By the time she was sitting outside her boss�s elegant home, she was in too deep. She had been swallowed by her anxiety and couldn�t think clearly enough to figure out how to ring the doorbell and go inside. Her world had gotten very small; at that moment it consisted entirely of her fears and that big, imposing house. Eventually I realized that I had my eye on the wrong thing too. I wanted Carrie to keep that job and the support of her boss. I wanted her to succeed in her profession and have enough money to allay her financial worries. I wanted very much for her to not rack up another failure. I wanted her to be happy.<br> Many years of being a therapist had honed my ability to work effectively with people. But in Carrie�s case I was operating under a wrong assumption. I believed she wanted to be happy.</p> <p> I was missing the paradox. For some people, happiness is upsetting. For them, every joy must be equalized by a setback. Too much success must be balanced by failure.</p> <p><strong> Comfort in Misery</strong><br> We are creatures of survival. We were biologically designed, engineered, and programmed to survive, more or less, at all costs. Yet survival can carry many faces. If, for whatever reason, misery seems necessary for our survival, we�ll choose misery.<br> Simplified, the logic goes like this:</p> <p> Something good happened to me�I was happy�Then this horrible thing followed or came from the same place or person that made me happy�I was nearly crushed by my grief. This means that happiness leads to crushing grief�Therefore, if I avoid happiness, I�ll protect myself from grief.</p> <p> Different people might substitute other words for happy, such as safe, joyful, free, or honored. Or they might use other words for grief, such as fear, disappointment, shame, or disaster. For example, I felt so special as they sang �Happy Birthday� to me. Then my father slapped me out of the chair, and I nearly died from shame. So if I can avoid being honored, I�ll protect myself from shame.</p> <p> In all of these cases, the internal logic is the same: people try to protect themselves against feeling bad by not feeling too good.</p> <p><em>Triggered by Joy</em><br> A triggering event is one that sets off an inevitable chain reaction. To trigger all the dominoes to fall, tip the first domino. To trigger yeast to grow, add water and sugar.</p> <p> Abstinent, recovering food addicts can get triggered by one cookie. It may take an hour or a week for the relapse to take hold, but the trigger is the first bite. From then on, for most sugar addicts, the slide into relapse is inevitable.</p> <p> For some of us, happiness itself can be a trigger, a trigger that makes a slide into misery equally inevitable. In Carrie�s case, she was triggered by a symbol of success, her boss�s appreciation and an invitation into the inner circle. These were positive, exciting possibilities, and Carrie recognized them as such. But that recognition caused a surge of anxiety for Carrie, and she ended up handling that anxiety by behaving in a way that made her unhappy�and made others unhappy with her.</p> <p> <em>Ensuring Misery</em><br> On the surface, Brian�s pattern seemed quite different. Though he hated hospitals, he worked as an orderly. He had a quick wit and an intelligent mind but stopped attending his advanced training program at the community college even though the course was interesting, his instructor was good, and the program could have led to a better job with more money.</p> <p> He lived in a dank, bare studio apartment that he hadn�t made comfortable. He dated women he did not love or even like. Nothing in life entranced him. He plodded from requirement to requirement without being engaged.</p> <p> He seemed to have an instinct for making choices that would keep him at that same dutiful, empty level of existence. If he needed to turn left to take the only available parking space, he�d turn right.</p> <p> When a coworker lovingly teased him, Brian took offense and chewed her out so harshly that the coworker, who had been taking some first steps toward an offer of friendship, decided not to pursue it.</p> <p> Brian was so afraid of happiness that he made sure he was always miserable.</p> <p> Brian and Carrie lead very different lives. Brian�s life is colorless and dark. Carrie is successful, and she has reason to be happy. But both keep making choices that maintain them at a carefully calibrated level of existence�beneath bliss and above despair. </p> <p><em>A Larger Addiction</em><br> Sugar made Stephanie fearful and listless. If she took a bite of a doughnut or two swigs of cola, within forty-eight hours she would be eating sugary foods addictively. Her whole focus would switch to her next bite�where, when, and how she�d get a new stash of sugar and eat it. She would be distracted from work and her relationships.</p> <p> When she abstained from sugar, Stephanie was clearheaded, made positive choices, and felt good. All aspects of her life improved.</p> <p> Through concentrated attention and effort, she stayed abstinent from sugar for seven months. Then she sent me an e-mail: �I lost my abstinence.�</p> <p> My heart groaned. I knew what would happen next. She was headed for a downhill slide in which she would binge on sugar more and more and feel ever worse about herself. Her abstinence had been hard-won. It would not be easily regained.<br> Was she just a typical addict, I wondered, with the typical propensity for relapse? Or was something larger going on?</p> <p> Among addicts of any stripe�alcoholics, drug addicts, food addicts, compulsive workers�some achieve a level of recovery in which their lives gradually improve and become more fulfilling. And there are others who relapse again and again.</p> <p> In some cases, the addiction has too firm a hold. The addict seemingly cannot become reconciled to a life without his addiction.<br> But there�s another category of people who relapse. These are the people who are triggered by recovery itself. They are also the people who we helping professionals have failed to help.</p> <p> Recovery brings clarity, friendships, and joy. It draws people into union with life. Serendipity shows up, again and again.<br> For some addicts, this is too much of a good thing.</p> <p> Why? Because a bigger addiction, a more powerful and more subtle addiction, is pulling the strings�an addiction to misery.<br> It�s a subtle addiction that has many faces, but the common thread is this: when things go too well or the person feels too good, she sabotages herself in order to return to the more comfortable or familiar state of misery, unhappiness, or grayness. In some cases, the mere possibility that things might go well or that good feelings might arise is enough to trigger behavior that brings back the misery.</p> <p> Brian nips joy in the bud....</p></p><h2>Darwin&#39;s House of Cards: A Journalist&#39;s Odyssey Through the Darwin Debates</h2><p>In this provocative history of contemporary debates over evolution, veteran journalist Tom Bethell depicts Darwin&#x2019;s theory as a nineteenth-century idea past its prime, propped up by logical fallacies, bogus claims, and empirical evidence that is all but disintegrating under an onslaught of new scientific discoveries. Bethell presents a concise yet wide-ranging tour of the flash points of modern evolutionary theory, investigating controversies over common descent, natural selection, the fossil record, biogeography, information theory, evolutionary psychology, artificial intelligence, and the growing intelligent design movement. Bethell&#x2019;s account is enriched by his own personal encounters with of some of our era&#x2019;s leading scientists and thinkers, including Harvard biologists Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin; British paleontologist Colin Patterson; and renowned philosopher of science Karl Popper.</p><p></p><h2>Biblical Greek Exegesis</h2><p><p>Biblical Greek Exegesis presents a proven, highly practical approach to the study of intermediate and advanced Greek grammar. Most textbooks focus on learning syntactical categories, illustrated by sentences taken from the Greek New Testament, and place little emphasis on how to apply Greek grammar to the Greek text in preparing sermons and lectures. In contrast, Biblical Greek Exegesis stresses &#x201c;real-life&#x201d; application. Beginning with selections from the Greek New Testament, students learn intermediate and advanced Greek grammar inductively by analyzing the text. The process closely resembles the approach used in sermon and lecture preparation. In Part 1 (SYNTAX), students work through nine selections from the New Testament, taken from the Gospels, Paul&#x2019;s letters (including Romans), and the General Letters. The selections are arranged in order of increasing difficulty. The student becomes familiar with syntactical categories through translation, grammatical analysis, and grammatical diagramming, supplemented by class discussion. Equally important, the length of these selections allows for semantic diagramming and analysis. This provides a tool for analyzing larger units of meaning, which is not possible when working only with sentences that illustrate specific points of grammar. In Part 2 (EXEGESIS), the student takes the sections from the Greek New Testament through a twelve-step method of exegesis and exposition. The student works through one section of approximately fifteen verses every two weeks, beginning with the first step&#x2014;spiritual preparation&#x2014;and ending with application and a preaching/teaching outline. This approach has two benefits. Advanced Greek students learn to use the Greek text and grammar as they will in the &#x201c;real world.&#x201d; They also learn to integrate other significant areas such as literary form and textual criticism, as well as the use of exegetical tools. In short, they become better expositors of the Word of God. Bibliographies are provided for each of the twelve steps in the exegetical process. Also included is a summary of syntactical categories based on Wallace&#x2019;s Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics. This successfully field-tested approach to intermediate and advanced Greek will help students bridge the gap between understanding the categories of Greek grammar and the demand to communicate the meaning and significance of the New Testament message to the twenty-first century.</p></p><p>Biblical Greek Exegesis is a combination textbook-workbook for intermediate and advanced Greek (second- and third-year Greek students) that moves away from the traditional deductive method to a modified inductive approach. This approach avoids the pitfalls that come when students confront the intricacies of syntax first and only later move on to exegesis--long after they&#39;ve lost heart and motivation. Biblical Greek Exegesis uses the first nine passages of Bill Mounce&#39;s Graded Reader of Biblical Greek. In addition to simple translation and grammatical analysis, this book encourages students to analyze each unit carefully through diagramming the Greek text grammatically and semantically, analyzing its words and concepts, conferring with major commentaries, seeing how the passage relates broader biblical and theological contexts, and finally, after deriving principles from the text, applying the passage to everyday life. The book is filled with exercises, helps in diagramming, and worksheets for all stages of the exegetical process. The authors, along with several other professors, of New Testament, have field-tested this course in the classroom--and watched students come alive with a deepening interest in studying the New Testament in its original language. Here is a commonsense, comprehensive exegetical method that will stay with students of New Testament Greek the rest of their lives.George H.

Yet few beyond her close friends and family have ever heard her account of her extraordinary journey. She writes with candor, humor and passion about her upbringing in suburban, middle-class America in the 1950s and her transformation from Goldwater Girl to student activist to controversial First Lady.<br><br><i>Living History</i> is her revealing memoir of life through the White House years. It is also her chronicle of living history with Bill Clinton, a thirty-year adventure in love and politics that survives personal betrayal, relentless partisan investigations and constant public scrutiny.<br> <br>Hillary Rodham Clinton came of age during a time of tumultuous social and political change in America. Like many women of her generation, she grew up with choices and opportunities unknown to her mother or grandmother. She charted her own course through unexplored terrain -- responding to the changing times and her own internal compass -- and became an emblem for some and a lightning rod for others. Wife, mother, lawyer, advocate and international icon, she has lived through America's great political wars, from Watergate to Whitewater.<br> <br>The only First Lady to play a major role in shaping domestic legislation, Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled tirelessly around the country to champion health care, expand economic and educational opportunity and promote the needs of children and families, and she crisscrossed the globe on behalf of women's rights, human rights and democracy. She redefined the position of First Lady and helped save the presidency from an unconstitutional, politically motivated impeachment. Intimate, powerful and inspiring, <i>Living History</i> captures the essence of one of the most remarkable women of our time and the challenging process by which she came to define herself and find her own voice -- as a woman and as a formidable figure in American politics.</p><p>As with most books written by politicians while in office (or at least aiming for one), <i>Living History</i> is, first and foremost, safe. There are interesting observations and anecdotes, the writing is engaging, and there is enough inside scoop to appeal to those looking for a bit of gossip, but there are no bombshells here and it is doubtful the book will change many minds about this polarizing figure. This does not mean the work is without merit, however, for Hillary Clinton has much to say about her experience as first lady, which is the primary focus of the book. Those interested in these experiences and her commentary on them will find the book worth reading; those looking for revelations will be disappointed. <p> </p><p> Beginning with a brief outline of her childhood, college years, introduction to politics, and her courtship with Bill Clinton, Clinton covers a wide variety of topics: life on the campaign trail, her troubled tenure as leader of the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform, meeting with foreign leaders, and her work on human rights, to name a few. By necessity, she also addresses the various scandals that plagued the administration, from Travelgate to Whitewater to impeachment, though she does not go into great detail about each one; rather, she seems content to simply state her case and move on without trying to settle too many old scores. </p><p> </p><p> Along the way, she offers many apologies, though perhaps not the kind some would expect. She does not shy away from her "vast right-wing conspiracy" comment, for instance, though she does wish that she had expressed herself differently. Regarding the Monica Lewinsky scandal, she maintains that her husband initially lied to her, as he did the rest of the country, and did not come clean until two days prior to his grand jury testimony. Calling his betrayal "the most devastating, shocking and hurtful experience of my life," she explains what the aftermath was like personally and why she has elected to stand by her man. In all, <i>Living History</i> is an informative book that goes a long way toward humanizing one of the most recognizable, and controversial, women of our age. <i>Shawn Carkonen</i></p>Hillary Rodham Clinton is the first woman in US&nbsp;history to become the presidential nominee of a major political party. She served as the 67th Secretary of State after nearly four decades in public service advocating on behalf of children and families as an attorney, First Lady, and US Senator.

Dew, shimmering like diamonds on the delicate leaves of the plants, was evaporating rapidly in the rays of the sun. The rich, dark earth was cool against Shelby's bare knees as she knelt between the two rows and began picking. She plucked some merlot lettuce from the ground, shook off the excess dirt, and placed it in her basket. It would go into the salad she was making for the St. Andrews Church potluck later that day.<br><br>She moved to the next row and chose some heads of butter lettuce. Its smooth, buttery taste would be the perfect complement to the full-bodied flavor of the merlot. Plus, the pale green of the butter lettuce and deep burgundy of the merlot would look beautiful together in the bowl.<br><br>Shelby had taken over Love Blossom Farm ten years ago, when her parents retired to spend their time traveling the country in their secondhand RV. She'd headed to Chicago after college, but city life hadn't suited her, and she'd been glad to return to Lovett, Michigan, and the place she loved more than anywhere else on earth.<br><br>Shelby grew lettuces and herbs that she sold to the Lovett General Store and also cultivated a kitchen garden, which provided her and her children with vegetables all year long-fresh in the spring and summer and canned or pickled the rest of the year. The speck of red in the distance was an old barn, where Patches, an aging calico cat, who was still nimble despite her advancing years, kept mice and other small critters at bay. Next to it was a chicken coop. Shelby kept a flock of cantankerous Rhode Island Reds that squawked for their feed every morning but presented her with a stream of large brown eggs. Jack Sparrow, a bantam rooster inherited from an elderly farmer her parents knew, strutted among them, keeping order.<br><br>Her basket full of lettuce, Shelby headed back to the farmhouse. It was old, with worn gray shingles and plumbing that was in a constant state of disrepair, but Shelby loved it. She pushed open the back door and went through the mudroom and into the kitchen.<br><br>She put the basket on the counter and filled the kitchen sink with cold water. Although she grew everything organically, it was still necessary to make sure the lettuce was free of any dirt or sand. She separated the leaves and put them in the water to soak.<br><br>Her computer was on a small table tucked into a corner of the kitchen. Shelby slipped into the chair she'd picked up at a going-out-of-business sale and powered on her laptop. She put her fingers on the keys and began to write.<br><br><i>Dear Reader,</i><br><br><i>Today is the church potluck fund-raiser. Poor St. Andrews is desperately in need of a new roof. Last Sunday it rained more inside the church than out. The St. Andrews Youth Group, under the direction of the Reverend Daniel Mather, who is beginning to look slightly harried, is erecting a large tent here on the grounds of Love Blossom Farm, and his wife, Prudence, is helping the Women's Auxiliary as they prepare to set up long folding tables for the food.</i><br><br><i>As I write this, my house is filled with the fragrance of a cottage cheese pie baking in the oven and a huge pot of dill and wax bean soup simmering on the stove. I made the cottage cheese earlier this morning, and used the whey in the soup instead of some of the stock. There are dozens of uses for whey, a by-product of making cheese, and it's packed with protein and vitamins and minerals.</i><br><br><i>The house is so peaceful. The children are quietly occupied in the living room. Amelia is practicing her piano and Billy is working on his latest model airplane. It is amazing how well they get along even though Amelia is about to turn thirteen and her younger brother is only eight . . .</i><br><br>"Mom!" Amelia screamed suddenly in the tone of utter disdain that only a preteen girl can achieve.<br><br>Shelby took her fingers from the keyboard and rushed out of the kitchen to see what was wrong. Because Amelia's tone made it very clear that something was wrong-of course, it could be anything from a wild bear breaking into the house and attacking them to the fact that she was down to one bar on her cell phone.<br><br>Shelby stopped dead in the hallway. "Not again!" She cried.<br><br><i>Dear Reader, Shelby composed in her head, I lied. The children are not playing happily together in the living room. No, indeed. Billy has gotten his head stuck in the banister railing again, and Amelia is amusing herself by taking pictures of him and texting them to her friends.</i><br><br>If she was going to write a blog, Shelby decided, she might as well be honest with her readers about the crazy, tumultuous, sometimes frustrating, and often wonderful life she was leading on Love Blossom Farm-give them the good with the bad, because that was life.<br><br>"Billy, didn't I tell you not to do that?"<br><br>"Aw, Mom, I didn't mean for my head to go all the way through, honest."<br><br>"I don't think you're going to be able to get it out this time," Amelia said without taking her eyes from her phone. Her curly blond hair and blue eyes made her look like an angel, which Shelby knew was a highly misleading resemblance.<br><br>"We've done it before, we can do it again. The ears are always the biggest problem."<br><br>Unfortunately, Billy's ears provided no hindrance to getting his head through the bars, but they sure did when it came to pulling it out. It was a matter of tilting his head at exactly the right angle. After all, if he got it in, surely they could get it out again?<br><br>Shelby studied her son. Exasperation combined with a tidal wave of affection washed over her. She loved every inch of him-from his dirty feet that looked too big for his body to the freckles scattered across his nose, the tiny chip in his front tooth from the time he fell off his bicycle, and the cowlick in his blond hair that was as stubborn as he was.<br><br>Shelby put her hands on either side of his face and turned his head slightly.<br><br>"Ouch," Billy yelled.<br><br>"He's faking," Amelia said with her eyes still glued to the phone in her hand.<br><br>Shelby grabbed the wooden railings on either side of Billy's head and put as much pressure on them as she could. If they moved even a millimeter, it would help.<br><br>"Come on, pull," she said. "Harder."<br><br>"Owww," Billy yelled again, but his head finally came free and he staggered backward. He rubbed the back of his head briskly, making his hair stand on end.<br><br>"Where are you going?" Shelby grabbed him by the strap of his overalls as he turned and tried to head back to the living room. "Not so fast."<br><br>"But cartoons are on."<br><br>"It's time to get ready for the potluck." Shelby gave him a gentle push toward the stairs.<br><br>"I am ready," Billy protested.<br><br>"You're not wearing those dirty old things." Shelby pointed to his stained and torn overalls. "Go wash your face and hands and put on a clean shirt and pair of pants."<br><br>Billy grumbled, but he did as he was told. Shelby let out a sigh. That would end soon enough, when he reached Amelia's age. Her daughter refused to listen to anything she said, and they argued more often than not. Shelby knew it was a stage. She just wished it would hurry past.<br><br>If the children's father were still alive, perhaps things would be different, Shelby thought. William "Wild Bill" McDonald had lived up to his name-dying in a motorcycle accident on a rain-slicked road one night several years ago. At the time, Shelby thought she would die from the pain of her loss, but over time the pain had lessened until it became a dull ache. Much to her surprise, entire days went by now when she didn't think about it.<br><br>Shelby went back to the kitchen, hit save on her computer, and powered it off. She would finish her blog later. She'd started writing <i>The Farmer's Daughter</i> during the long, lonely winter nights mostly to amuse herself and chronicle her little family's life on the farm, but the blog had taken off and she now had a respectable following. She loved sharing recipes and cooking and gardening tips along with the challenges and joys of being a single parent and running Love Blossom Farm. If she didn't post for a day or two, readers would actually e-mail her to ask if everything was okay.<br>Everyone at St. Andrews had prayed for good weather for the potluck, and it looked as if they'd been successful. Only the faintest wisps of clouds floated in the blue sky, and the breeze was soft and gentle. Shelby paused on her front steps. Even though she�d grown up on Love Blossom Farm, she never tired of the view of the rolling green hills of southwestern Michigan.<br><br>She took a deep breath, savoring the scent of newly mown grass and fresh hay mixed with the faintest hint of manure. That last wasn't a scent most people cared for, but to Shelby it smelled like home. And if the wind was coming from the east and Jake Taylor's dairy farm, there would be more than a mere hint of manure in the air. It was possible to have too much of a good thing, Shelby thought.<br><br>Next to the farmhouse, with its welcoming front porch cluttered with wicker rocking chairs and pots of flowers, was a large pasture that Shelby leased to Jake. He kept a herd of black-and-white dairy cows and, in exchange for a reduced rent, provided Shelby with enough milk to make the cheeses she sold to the Lovett General Store.<br><br>When Prudence Mather had approached Shelby about holding the potluck at Love Blossom Farm, she had readily agreed to the plan. When Shelby's husband died four years ago, members of the church had wrapped their arms around her and her family, bringing them dinner every night for weeks, stopping by to keep her company in those early days, running errands when she was still too dazed to drive. She was glad she could now return the favor in some small way.<br><br>The farmhouse was set far back from the road with a sweeping and fairly level front lawn bordered by a white fence. It was the perfect venue for the dozens of people expected to attend.<br><br>"Whoa," someone yelled suddenly.<br><br>Shelby looked in the direction of the shout. The tent was tilting precariously to the right. The women scurried out of the way, chattering like Shelby's chickens when she came out with their feed in the morning.<br><br>Daniel Mather, the newly appointed rector of St. Andrews, was gesturing wildly. He was decidedly sweaty now, and Shelby was pretty sure that he was muttering a couple of choice words under his breath, despite being a minister. She knew she would.<br><br>"Grab that rope." He gestured frantically to one of the members of the youth group, a skinny kid with glasses. "No, the other one. No, that one over there."<br><br>The young boy hesitated like a baseball player trying to decide whether to steal second base as he attempted to make sense of the reverend's contradictory instructions.<br><br>The tent listed farther and a high-pitched scream went up from one of the women.<br><br>"Daniel, please be careful. You could get hurt." Prudence Mather scurried over to where her husband was trying to deal with the uncooperative tent.<br><br>Daniel gave Prudence the same sort of look that Shelby's husband used to give her whenever she told him to be careful. She'd seen other men do it, too. It was their <i>I am a man and therefore invincible, so please don't emasculate me by telling me to be careful</i> look.<br><br>Prudence was wearing powder blue capris, with a flowered top and matching blue sandals. She would have been homely if not for her eyes, which were large and deep sapphire blue.<br><br>"Need some help?" Jake stepped over the fence separating the front lawn of Love Blossom Farm from the pastures beyond and strolled over to the group. He looked more like a cowboy than a dairy farmer-dressed in worn jeans, a faded blue work shirt, and cowboy boots.<br><br>"Thank you," Prudence gushed, squeezing Jake's arm before scooting out of the way.<br><br>Jake studied the tent, then grabbed one of the ropes and pulled. Slowly the tent righted itself and a sigh of relief went up from the crowd.<br><br>"Got a hammer?" Jake held the rope with one hand and untied the knot anchoring it to the stake with the other.<br><br>Daniel rushed over to Jake and handed him a large hammer with a red handle. He stood back and ran his finger around his collar. He wasn't wearing his clerical collar but was dressed informally in a short-sleeved shirt and khakis.<br><br>"Thanks. I want to hammer this stake in a little further. If you'll hold this rope . . ."<br><br>Daniel grabbed the rope with two hands while Jake pounded the stake a couple of inches farther into the ground. Daniel handed him the rope. Jake quickly tied it to the stake and gave it an extra tug for good measure.<br><br>"We can't thank you enough," Daniel said.<br><br>"My pleasure." Jake stood up and brushed some bits of grass from the knees of his jeans.<br><br>He ambled over to where Shelby was standing.<br><br>"You need any help with anything?" He shaded his eyes with one hand and smiled at Shelby. She noticed that the expression created attractive crinkles around his blue eyes.<br><br>She gestured toward the crowd on her front lawn. "Thanks, but I haven't been given any jobs to do besides bringing the dishes I'm contributing."<br><br>"I'm afraid I wouldn't be of any help to you there." Jake laughed. "My cooking skills consist of microwaving, opening take-out containers, and peeling the plastic off frozen pizzas."<br><br>The thought of someday inviting Jake to dinner flashed through Shelby's mind. She knew he found her attractive, by the way he looked at her and how he was always offering to do little things to help her out. She certainly found him more than attractive. Someday. She wasn't quite ready yet.<br><br>Prudence came over to where Shelby was standing. "What have you made for the potluck, dear? I read your blog all the time, and those recipes!" Prudence clasped her hands together and rolled her eyes heavenward. "They all sound so delicious."</p><h2>Gosnell: The Untold Story of America&#39;s Most Prolific Serial Killer</h2><p><b>NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE OPENING IN THEATERS EVERYWHERE</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <br> <b>&#x201c;This book is a public service.&#x201d;&nbsp;</b><b>&#x2014; MICHELLE MALKIN, founder of Twitchy and author of&nbsp;<i>Culture of Corruption</i></b><br> <br> <b>&#x201c;Every American needs to read&nbsp;<i>Gosnell</i>.&#x201d;&nbsp; </b><b>&#x2014; DAVID&nbsp;DALEIDEN, the Center for American Progress reporter behind the undercover investigation of Planned Parenthood</b><br> <br> <b>"Ann and Phelim courageously tell the heart wrenching, shocking story previously ignored, one that every American needs&nbsp;to read." </b><b>&#x2014;&nbsp;</b><b>KATIE PAVLICH,&nbsp;<i>Townhall&nbsp;</i>Editor and Fox News Contributor.&nbsp;</b><br> <br> He is America&#x2019;s most prolific serial killer.

He spent his early life in America and studied in Geneva, London and Paris during his adolescence to gain the worldly experience so prized by his father. He lived in Newport, went briefly to Harvard Law School, and in 1864 began to contribute both criticism and tales to magazines.<br><br>In 1869, and then in 1872-74, he paid visits to Europe and began his first novel,&nbsp;<b>Roderick Hudson</b>. Late in 1875 he settled in Paris, where he met Turgenev, Flaubert, and Zola, and wrote&nbsp;<b>The American</b>&nbsp;(1877). In December 1876 he moved to London, where two years later he achieved international fame with&nbsp;<b>Daisy Miller</b>. Other famous works include&nbsp;<b>Washington Square</b>&nbsp;(1880),&nbsp;<b>The Portrait of a Lady</b>&nbsp;(1881),&nbsp;<b>The Princess Casamassima</b>(1886),&nbsp;<b>The Aspern Papers</b>&nbsp;(1888),&nbsp;<b>The Turn of the Screw</b>&nbsp;(1898), and three large novels of the new century,<b>The Wings of the Dove</b>&nbsp;(1902),&nbsp;<b>The Ambassadors</b>&nbsp;(1903) and&nbsp;<b>The Golden Bowl</b>&nbsp;(1904). In 1905 he revisited the United States and wrote&nbsp;<b>The American Scene</b>&nbsp;(1907).<br><br>During his career he also wrote many works of criticism and travel. Although old and ailing, he threw himself into war work in 1914, and in 1915, a few months before his death, he became a British subject. In 1916 King George V conferred the Order of Merit on him. He died in London in February 1916.<br><br><b>David Lodge</b> is the author of twelve novels and a novella, including the Booker Prize finalists&nbsp;<b>Small World</b>&nbsp;and<b>Nice Work</b>. He is also the author of many works of literary criticism, including&nbsp;<b>The Art of Fiction</b>&nbsp;and<b>Consciousness and the Novel</b>.This gem does true justice to James&#39;s vision. His characters maneuver in the realm of those who&#39;ve preserved their integrity while losing their heart&#39;s desire, their fineness and delicacy inadequate armature for the rough world. Maureen O&#39;Brien&#39;s reading splendidly creates the three central characters, her Mrs. Gareth being particularly arresting. There is great wit in this novel of repressed and diverted emotion, great comedy before the final bitterness. This reader delivers it unerringly, her sense of timing and appropriate emotion rendering with careful precision the characters&#39; words and the passions behind them. E.J.M.

A high-ranking and very powerful Vatican office suddenly and very publicly confronted the organization with forceful questions and negative assumptions about the foundation of the lives of Catholic sisters. The conflict grew more intense midway through those years. The Vatican office threatened the autonomy and even the existence of the organization, an organization on which the great majority of US Catholic sisters rely for many kinds of resources, supports, and connections. The experience rocked LCWR&#x2019;s officers, its hundreds of members, and the approximately 60,000 sisters who belonged to member congregations at that time. Yet the ultimate resolution benefitted everyone. How did that happen? This book answers that question. It not only explains how the organization worked through a very difficult situation, but it provides spiritual grounding, useful information, and perhaps some inspiration and hope to anyone working through a situation of conflict, polarization, or even impasse in their own personal, professional, family, community, neighborhood, or organizational settings. The situation on which this book is based began in 2009 when the Vatican&#x2019;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) shocked LCWR with its 2009 announcement that it was beginning a &#x201c;doctrinal assessment&#x201d; &#x2013; an investigation of LCWR&#x2019;s faithfulness to the church to which women religious have dedicated their lives. The organization was stunned as well when CDF announced in 2012 that it had concluded its study and was appointing an archbishop who would be assisted by two other bishops to oversee a reform of LCWR as a result of its investigation. LCWR&#x2019;s identity, autonomy, and survival were in question. LCWR&#x2019;s members were devastated. No one involved with the situation could see a clear or obvious path toward resolution. During those years and since that time LCWR was asked by many to tell the story of how the organization and how its leaders navigated this time of tremendous obvious risk as well as less visible personal pain and, ultimately, blessing. Reporters have wanted the organization to offer an expos� of the unrevealed details of what provoked this investigation and of &#x201c;who said what when&#x201d; in the very slow process of its resolution. This is not that tell-all book. This is a serious effort to describe what LCWR&#x2019;s leaders learned personally and as an organization about how to weather a crisis in ways that create a new and better reality. This book is the product of reflection over time. The authors had long pondered if there was any benefit to their telling LCWR&#x2019;s story and their own stories to the public. Their reticence was palpable primarily because it had been such a sacred journey for them and they wanted it to be respected as such. Conscious of the dire national and international conflict existent today, the authors chose to risk telling their story with the hope that it could offer a way forward for others. Readers will see how these women handled the challenges that confront any leaders in crises &#x2013; what goals to pursue, what overall strategies to use, when to share or withhold information within the organization and with the public, how to find or create a solution. They will also see how they called on rich spiritual and cultural traditions. The formal methods, processes, and practices used are readily translatable for use in other communities and organizations. These learnings are practical options that may help others to create new and better realities in their own parts of the world.</p><p>These reflections offered by the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR)describe&nbsp; what the organization learned as it went through a six-year public crisis. The book details the values,attitudes, and practices that helped the organization navigate a situation that could easily have resulted in fractured relationships and polarization, but did not. The authors share a variety of processes and conceptual frameworks that can be valuable for anyone living or leading in a complex and challenging situation of conflict.Annmarie Sanders, IHM has been serving as the director of communications of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious since 2003.

Sadia Shepard, the daughter of a white Protestant from Colorado and a Muslim from Pakistan, was shocked to discover that her grandmother was a descendant of the Bene Israel, a tiny Jewish community shipwrecked in India two thousand years ago. After traveling to India to put the pieces of her family's past together, her quest for identity unlocks a myriad of profound religious and cultural revelations that Shepard gracefully weaves into this touching, eye-opening memoir.</p><p>Sadia Shepard is a documentary filmmaker and writer who lives in New York City. She graduated from Wesleyan University in 1997, from the Graduate Program in Documentary Film and Video at Stanford University in 2000, and began her work with the Bene Israel community of India while on a Fulbright Scholarship. This is her first book.Starred Review. Who is Rachel Jacobs? the 13-year-old asks her Muslim grandmother Rahat Siddiqi; that, Nana tells her, was my name before I was married. Thus does a grandmother's stunning reply and a granddaughter's promise to learn about her ancestors set Shepard's three voyages of discovery in motion: her grandmother's history; the story of the Bene Israel (one of the lost tribes of Israel that, having sailed from Israel two millennia ago, crashed on the Konkan coast in India; and her own self-discovery (her mother was Muslim, her father Christian, and her grand mother Jewish). Shepard balances all three journeys with dexterity as she spends her Fulbright year, with an old hand-drawn map and her grandmother's family tree, unraveling the mysteries of Nana's past while visiting and photographing the grand and minuscule synagogues in Bombay and on the Konkan Coast. A filmmaker, Shepard writes with a lively sense of pacing (her year proceeds chronologically, interspersed with well-placed flashbacks) and a keen sense of character (getting to know her friend, escort and fellow filmmaker Rekhev as gradually as she does, or capturing the Muslim baker who makes the only authentic challah in Bombay in a few strokes). Shepard's story is entertaining and instructive, inquiring and visionary. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Pairing wine and food can bring out the best qualities in each. But how do you hit upon the right combination? And is there just one? Do you fall back on the old rules or decide by cuisine or season? The choices can be perplexing, and fashions are constantly changing. Eric Asimov and Florence Fabricant have spent much of their careers enjoying this most delicious dilemma and now give readers the tools they need to play the game of wine and food to their own tastes. <br><br>In this book, they sum up some of their most useful findings. Instead of a rigid system, <i>Wine with Food</i> offers guiding information to instill confidence so you can make your own choices. The goal is to break the mold of traditional pairing models and open up new possibilities. Asimov focuses on wines of distinction and highlights certain producers to look for. Fabricant offers dishes covering every course and drawing from diverse global influences-Clams with Chorizo, Autumn Panzanella, Duck Fried Rice, Coq au Vin Blanc, Short Ribs with Squash and Shiitakes. Sidebars explore issues related to the entire experience at the table-such as combining sweet with savory, the right kind of glass, and decanting.

It&#39;s about first love and the end of innocence in all its passion and absurdity. It&#39;s about the raw transition between loving your parents as a child and understanding them as an adult. It&#39;s about the cool friend for whom everything seems effortless, and the impossibly embarrassing friend you&#39;re nice to when your cool friends can&#39;t see. It&#39;s about the struggle between desire and duty, and about a chance meeting with a twenty-seven-year-old man. And it&#39;s about what happens after. Pure has the shocking immediacy that made Less Than Zero so indelible. It evokes the brutalities of adolescence with the lucidity of Two Girls, Fat and Thin. It is sure to establish its author as one of the most remarkable and fearless young writers to emerge in recent years.</p><p>"I was about thirteen when I started letting the boys feel me up." Thus the reader is catapulted directly into the conflicted world of a smalltown English schoolgirl in 20-year-old Ray's relentlessly driven debut novel (she left school at 16 to write it). The narrator (whose name is never given) lives with her constantly bickering hippie vegetarian parents and her younger brother. Her self-pitying, feckless father obsesses over her homework, friends and clothes, and enlists her aid in belittling and disparaging her mother. When she reaches high school, the narrator desperately wants to join the in-crowd. She's in luck when she starts dating Robin, who is part of the popular group. Soon she abandons her former, less cool friends and spends lunch hours "snogging" with Robin. Strangely, Robin's touch does not appeal to the narrator until he hits her and she experiences her first sexual response. Robin loses his masochistic appeal when he says that he loves her, and the narrator moves on to Oliver, a 27-year-old consumer electronics salesman. Oliver's rough treatment proves orgasmic; his escalating violence releases her impulses toward self-mutilation. The narrator's befogged passivity (evidenced by her constant repetition of the phrase "I wondered") and her fascination with the sordidness of the physical side of life (a favorite word is "disgusted") make her mind a somewhat claustrophobic place to be, while her eventual insights into her family dysfunction will seem dated to those who grew up with Catcher in the Rye. However, the novel's structureAshort segments, no chapters and zingy clinchersAmoves this compelling story along swiftly to a surprising conclusion. The narration is leavened with touches of deadpan humor and spot-on observations that add credibility and demonstrate Ray's promise as a writer, despite some evidence of immaturity in her craft. Agent, Patrick Walsh. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.A British debut novel, penned by a (then) 16-year-old author, offers the intense immediacy of teenage youth--though often without the forward momentum and richness of texture of a fully accomplished work.The unnamed narrator is a 14-year-old girl who describes, in detail at times biting and at others long-winded, the travails of teenage life in a coastal English town. A bit awkward when she begins school, she learns how to fit in with the cool kids by letting the boys stick their hands up her skirt during break. Soon she has a clique of friends and a mean-spirited, acne-covered boyfriend named Robin, whom she meets for lunch to smoke pot and roll around on the grass with. Slowly her real psyche is revealed when Robin begins to hit her: she likes it, or, more accurately, craves the extreme sensation to feel alive. So begins the narrator's masochism. When Robin falls in love with her, she pushes away his gentleness and begins dating 31-year-old Oliver. More interesting, though, than her romantic relationships are her familial ones--with her loving if volatile father and silent mother, left-wingers who have slipped into a life of disillusionment and endless arguing. Her parents' fighting, the increasingly violent relationship with Oliver, and her gradual withdrawal from school life set the stage for self-mutilation as she cuts herself repeatedly--another desperate act for some kind of cold comfort. While the speaker provides a bleak, honest assessment of youthful angst, too much, given all that happens, is left unsaid or unexplained: her parents' acceptance of a grown man sleeping with their daughter (in their house); her largely undisclosed relationships with friends; and, most importantly, the lack of self-reflection on the teller's part.Graphic and guileless, as well as underdeveloped, though admittedly intriguing if only because of the author's youth. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

During the last fifteen years of his life he won for himself the reading public, first in France, then in Germany and America, and finally in England. In his funeral oration the spokesman of the most artistic and critical of European nations, Ernest Renan, hailed him as one of the greatest writers of our times: 'The Master, whose exquisite works have charmed our century, stand more than any other man as the incarnation of the whole race,' because 'a whole world lived in him and spoke through his mouth.' Rudin is the first of Turgenev's social novels, and is a sort of artistic introduction to those that follow, because it refers to the epoch anterior to that when the present social and political movements began.

After the family had moved to Moscow in 1827 he entered Petersburg University where he studied philosophy. When he was nineteen he published his first poems and, convinced that Europe contained the source of real knowledge, went to the University of Berlin. After two years he returned to Russia and took his degree at the University of Moscow. In 1843 he fell in love with Pauline Garcia-Viardot, a young Spanish singer, who influenced the rest of his life; he followed her on her singing tours in Europe and spent long periods in the French house of herself and her husband, both of whom accepted him as a family friend. He sent his daughter by a sempstress to be brought up among the Viardot children. After 1856 he lived mostly abroad, and he became the first Russian writer to gain a wide reputation in Europe; he was a well-known figure in Parisian literary circles, where his friends included Flaubert and the Goncourt brothers, and an honorary degree was conferred on him at Oxford.

"When I was in the camp," her father's stories always begin. Although she lives in the everyday world of school and friends, a daughter is compelled by love to enter her father's harrowing world of hunger, death, and survival in the concentration camp. In a moving Afterword, the author sets the historical context for the novel and speaks directly about her own father, upon whom the novel is based. "An extraordinary novel written with passion, lucidity, and restraint" (<i>The Forward</i>).</p><p>Nightfather is a novel about the Holocaust like no other. Written in a deeply affecting style mixing lightness with gravity, it captures not only the experience of the concentration camp, but also its powerful legacy, passed down to a new generation through the enormous bond of love that ties parent and child. In forty brief chapters, the young daughter of a survivor tells of the efforts she and her two brothers make to try to bridge the gulf between themselves and their father that has been formed by his camp experiences. Unlike many of his generation, who remain silent, their father feels compelled to repeat the details of his ordeal. The children inhabit two worlds at once: the world of school and their friends, and their father&#39;s nightmare world of hunger, gas, and the crematoria. Every ordinary incident - a trip to the zoo, a drive in the country, an invitation to join Brownies - evokes a memory and a story of the camp. What are children to make of stories of humiliation and murder? Where do the stories stop and reality begin? Striving to find a balance, the children consider their father&#39;s world in terms of their own. They have had chicken pox and measles; he has &#34;camp&#34;. Toothpaste is not only for brushing teeth, but also for emergency use to prevent thirst. As their father prowls restlessly through the house at night, telling them more and more about the camp, the children&#39;s essential innocence remains strangely intact, making its horrors at once easier to face and all the more harrowing. Gradually, with accumulating force, the story of one man&#39;s imprisonment and the terms of his survival are revealed.<b>Carl Friedman</b> was born in the Netherlands in 1952 and now lives in Amsterdam.</p><h2>The Nick Tosches Reader</h2><p><i>Newsday</i> has said that Nick Tosches "casts brilliant black light." The <i>San Diego Reader</i> has said that "Tosches's best sentences uncoil like rattlesnakes and strike with a venom that spreads poison through all the little Sunday-school ideas you've held dear." And <i>Rolling Stone</i> has said that "Tosches can write like a wild rockabilly raveup. He can be elegant as a slow blues." <i>The Nick Tosches Reader</i> is the author's own selection of his best work over the past thirty years, including fiction, poetry, interviews, rock writing, investigative journalism, and criticism. First published in major magazines, obscure underground periodicals, and his own best-selling books, many of these selections deal with rock 'n' roll and cultural icons&#x2014;but there are also pieces on everything from William Faulkner to organized crime to heavyweight boxing, including the <i>Vanity Fair</i> feature that gave rise to Tosches's major new book on Sonny Liston, published by Little, Brown. Here is "a unique and darkly impressionistic cultural history" of the last three decades as only Nick Tosches could write it.</p><p><b>Nick Tosches </b>is the author of<i> Hellfire, Unsung Heroes of Rock 'n' Roll, Power on Earth, Cut Numbers, Dino, </i>and <i>Trinities.</i>Tosches is best known for his 100-proof biographies of Dean Martin and Jerry Lee Lewis, and his beautifully trenchant life of the prize-fighter Sonny Liston (see review above) will arrive to the timely accompaniment of this collection from his diverse writing career, showing Tosches to be more than a gifted, dogged chronicler of flawed public figures. The Reader contains more than 100 pieces, including excerpts from the author's nonfiction, his two novels (Cut Numbers, Trinities), dozens of magazine pieces that appeared in such publications as Rolling Stone, Esquire and Vanity Fair (to which Tosches is now a contributing editor) and riffs on Charles Olson's Maximus Poems, Sinatra's voice, Miles Davis's horn, Carly Simon's mouth and "The Singer Madonna Arraigned by the Ghost of Pope Alexander VI." While these pieces, taken together, show the arc of a successful career, they also give a glimpse of a period in magazine writing that is long gone, in which hell-bent editors such as Lester Bangs would assign a review of a new album and the reviewer could simply talk about how the packaging felt in his hands. Tosches, early in his career, paid his bills with small fees garnered as a music critic, and this lively era of no-holds-barred journalism (later to be dubbed "New") is on raunchy display here. Creem asked Tosches to interview Patti Smith, and the rock-poet says, "Hell, Nick, you know me. Just make it up." And he does. In Rock magazine, he reviewed an album that never existed ("It is indeed quite difficult to approach this album with the pedestrian sensibilities that suffice for most musical creations"). The term "pedestrian" will never be applied to Tosches--neither in his interests nor his prose style. In this carefully constructed collection, for which Tosches provides contextual links and anecdotes about the composition of each piece, readers will get a complex and satisfying portrait not only of a time but of a deeply reflective and probing writer who, beneath the din of music and gangsters and poseurs, hears what he calls "the wisdom and power of silence and wind."

Firmly based on biblical teaching, this book has provided spiritual help to Evangelicals, Protestants, and Roman Catholics in recovery. Now in its 3rd edition, this book thoroughly integrates biblical teaching with the Twelve Steps to provide a solid spiritual foundation for Christians in recovery from addiction. Written also for those who practice the Twelve Steps, but are not Christians, the familiar language of The Gospel and the Twelve Steps can provide a palatable means for those Twelve-Step practitioners who are resistant to Christianity to develop a spiritually vital relationship with Jesus Christ. The Gospel and the Twelve Steps weaves scripture directly into the text and adds highly relevant biblical commentary from several widely known, beloved authors whose wisdom has stood the test of time. Including C.S. Lewis, George MacDonald, William Barclay, and others, these teachers&#x2019; words relate directly to the Twelve-Step program of recovery. The combination of ample scriptural references, thoroughly integrated into the text, along with highly relevant commentary, makes The Gospel and the Twelve Steps unique among books for Christians in recovery.</p><p>Rev.

Chronicling the story of New York from its establishment as a Dutch trading post in 1624 to its global preeminence today, the book is at once the biography of a great city and a vivid exploration of the myriad forces -- commercial, cultural, demographic -- that converged in New York to usher in the contemporary world.<br><br>Weaving the strands of the city's sweeping history into a single compelling narrative, New York carries us through nearly four centuries of turbulent growth and change -- from the first settlement on the tip of "Manna-hata" Island to the destruction wrought by the Revolutionary War; to the city's stunning emergence in the nineteenth century as the nation's premier industrial metropolis; to the waves of early-twentieth-century immigration that forever transformed the city and the nation; to New York's transfiguration as the world's first modern city -- pioneering skyscrapers, apartment houses, subways, and highways -- and its role as the birthplace of so much of American popular culture. Along the way, we witness the building of the city's celebrated landmarks and neighborhoods, from the Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty to the Empire State Building and the United Nations; from Wall Street and Times Square to the Lower East Side, Harlem, and SoHo.<br><br>The book brims with vibrant illustrations, including hundreds of rare photographs, paintings, lithographs, prints, and period maps. The narrative incorporates the voices and stories of men and women -- statesmen, entrepreneurs, artists, and visionaries -- who have lived in and built the city: an extraordinary cast of characters that includes Peter Stuyvesant, Alexander Hamilton, John Jacob Astor, Walt Whitman, Boss Tweed, Jacob Riis, Emma Lazarus, J. P. Morgan, Al Smith, F. Scott Fitzgerald, George Gershwin, Fiorello La Guardia, Robert Moses, and Jane Jacobs.<br><br>Accompanying the book's narrative are interviews with Robert A. Caro, David Levering Lewis, and Robert A. M. Stern, and essays by a group of distinguished New York historians and critics -- Kenneth T. Jackson, Mike Wallace, Marshall Berman, Phillip Lopate, Carol Berkin, and Daniel Czitrom -- who add their insights about the city to this splendid history.</p><p>There are a million stories in the wicked city, and <i>New York: An Illustrated History</i> contains hundreds of them. From its 17th-century beginnings as a small Dutch colony on the far edge of an empire to its late-20th-century status as one of the world's greatest cities, New York has been home to millions of fascinating people. Take, for example, Edward Hyde, royal governor of New York from 1702 to 1708. Hyde, cousin of Queen Anne, was heartily disliked by the colonists--in part because he was reputed to dress in women's clothing ("I represent a woman, and ought in all respects to resemble her as faithfully as I can," Hyde was reported to have said). Or Al Smith, son of immigrants, a day laborer, who worked his way up the political ladder and eventually became Governor of New York. Or Rosie Safran, a seamstress who survived the horrible fire that claimed 146 of her coworkers at the Triangle shirtwaist factory.<p> PBS darling Ric Burns (brother of Ken) teamed up with James Sanders and Lisa Ades to produce this spectacular volume and the accompanying 12-hour series. Some 500 illustrations enhance the narrative, while essays by and interviews with prominent New Yorkers-- Robert A. Caro, Carol Berkin, and David Levering Lewis among them--highlight their visions of the metropolis, past and present. New Yorkers or not, readers will enjoy stories of how the city grew and changed over time--such as in 1699, when the old Dutch city wall was torn down and a later-to-be-famous street laid out in its place; or in a 10-day period in 1930, when 14 new floors of the Empire State Building were erected. Along the way, the authors debunk a few myths: the Dutch didn't really pay only $24 for Manhattan, and no immigrant's name was known to have been changed by the Ellis Island inspectors--though the ships' manifests they were consulting may have been incorrect.</p><p> Burns and company are clearly enamored of New York, seeing it as "the ultimate city of dreaming and desire, a place of passage and transformation, of possibility and exchange, of mingled cultures and identities." They also see New York, with all its ups, downs, problems, and triumphs, as a microcosm of the modern world.

Krishnamurti and G. I. Gurdjieff.&nbsp; Dr. Ravindra&#x2019;s&nbsp; fresh prose translation with wide-ranging commentary, is the fruit of that lifelong process.&nbsp; It stands out from the many other versions with its assertion that the Bhagavad Gita is at heart a universal guide to navigating the battle of life required of each and every one of us. It is through that navigation, he shows, that we can discover and connect with the Krishna deep within ourselves:&nbsp; The Eternal Witness who is above the battle, and who is, ultimately and joyfully, all there is.</p><p>Ravi Ravindra, PhD, is Professor Emeritus at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia where he served many years as a professor of comparative religion, philosophy, and physics.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He is the author of numerous other books, including&nbsp; <i>Science and the Sacred, The Wisdom of Pata�jali&#x2019;s Yoga Sutras</i>, and <i>The Pilgrim Soul.</i>&#x201c;A commentary on the Bhagavad Gita that is in a class of its own.&nbsp;The background story from the Mahabharata and its characters come alive. &nbsp;Almost&nbsp;no commentary on this ancient scripture emphasizes an historical battle&nbsp;but rather, all take pains to point to it as a metaphor for the battle&nbsp;within. &nbsp;However none so superbly take us within, to the very place of the&nbsp;battle raging within each one of us, as Ravi Ravindra's does. In so doing&nbsp;he truly makes come alive the promise of Krishna in Chapter Six that, &#x2018;Yoga is&nbsp;breaking the bond with suffering.&#x201d;&#x2014;Swami Ambikananda Saraswati,&nbsp;Author, Founder of Traditional Yoga Association, UK<br><br>"This engaging new rendition of one of the world's most venerated works opens up many of its dimensions that have usually been hidden.

His commentary on this classic text of yoga invites a sincere and practical engagement with the text and raises many questions for our lives.

On the day of his father's death, Ahmad listens closely as the seemingly immortal elder tells him the tale of a centuries-old family curse . . . and the boy's own fated role in the story. <br><br>Ahmad grows up to suspect that something unseen must be interfering with his family, as he struggles to hold them together through decades of famine, loss, and political turmoil in Iran. As the world transforms around him, each turn of Ahmad's life is a surprise: from street brawler to father of two impossibly gifted daughters; from radical poet to politician with a target on his back. These lives, and the many unforgettable stories alongside his, converge and catch fire at the center of the Revolution. <br><br>A sweeping, multi-generational epic, this stunning debut heralds the arrival of a unique new literary voice.

In this brief and evocative narrative, he shares for the first time his journey as a Latino immigrant and openly gay man discovering a new, emotional understanding of what it means to be an American. He tells the story of the call from the White House committee and all the exhilaration and upheaval of the days that followed. He reveals the inspiration and challenges behind the creation of the inaugural poem, &#x201c;One Today,&#x201d; as well as two other poems commissioned for the occasion (&#x201c;Mother Country&#x201d; and &#x201c;What We Know of Country&#x201d;), published here for the first time ever, alongside translations of all three of those poems into his native Spanish. Finally, Blanco reflects on his life-changing role as a public voice since the inauguration, his spiritual embrace of Americans everywhere, and his vision for poetry&#x2019;s new role in our nation&#x2019;s consciousness. Like the inaugural poem itself, <i>For All of Us, One Today</i> speaks to what makes this country and its people great, marking a historic moment of hope and promise in our evolving American landscape.<br><br><b>In 2017, U2 is&nbsp;featuring &#x201c;One Today&#x201d; during their Joshua Tree tour throughout the United States and Europe.

Standing as the youngest, first Latino, first immigrant, and first openly gay person to serve in such a role, he read his inaugural poem, &#x201c;One Today,&#x201d; as an honorary participant in the official ceremony on January 21, 2013. Blanco was made in Cuba, assembled in Spain, and imported to the United States, meaning that his mother, seven months pregnant, and the rest of the family arrived as exiles from Cuba to Madrid, where he was born. Only forty-five days later the family emigrated once more and settled in Miami, where Blanco was raised and educated. The negotiation of cultural identity and universal themes of place and belonging characterize his three collections of poetry, which include <i>City of a Hundred Fires</i> (awarded the Agnes Starrett Poetry Prize from the University of Pittsburgh Press), <i>Directions to the Beach of the Dead </i>(recipient of the Beyond Margins Award from the PEN American Center), and <i>Looking for The Gulf Motel</i> (winner of the Patterson Poetry Prize, a Maine Literary Poetry Award, and the Thom Gunn Award). His poems have also appeared in the Best American Poetry, and Great American Prose Poems series, and he has been featured on <i>CBS Sunday Morning</i>, and National Public Radio&#x2019;s <i>All Things Considered </i>and <i>Fresh Air</i>, as well as major U.S. and international media, including CNN, Telemundo, <i>AC360</i>, the BBC, Univision, and PBS. Blanco is a fellow of the Bread Loaf Writers Conference, recipient of two Florida Artist Fellowships, and a Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow. A builder of cities as well as poems, he is also a professional civil engineer currently living in Bethel, Maine.Days before our field trip to the science center, Mrs. Bermudez tells our class the sun is actually hundreds of times larger than the earth. <i>We move around it. We&#x2019;re nothing, zooming through dark space</i>, she says, matter-of-factly, as if it didn&#x2019;t matter that we were no longer the center of our own little worlds. We, with crayons in our hands coloring dittos of the sun and our nine planets. We, at our desks but also helplessly zooming through cold, empty space. I don&#x2019;t want to believe her; the sun is the size of a sunflower, I insist. I draw lemon-yellow petals around it and color its center sienna brown. The first time I see a lion I am nine years old, my grandfather&#x2019;s hands holding me back from the cage I want to open. I can still feel his grip and the lion&#x2019;s eyes staring at me like tiny, amber planets behind bars, asking me to set him free. My first kiss was under the shade of moonlit palms in Janet Carballo&#x2019;s backyard, exactly two days before the end of the school year. But I&#x2019;m still feeling the powdery skin behind her earlobes, smelling her strawberry lip gloss and the orange blossoms in the air already thick with summer. I never saw a comet until I was twenty-four, cupped in the darkness of the Everglades and the arms of a man I loved. It was past midnight on a Sunday, I remember; I didn&#x2019;t go to work the next day. I&#x2019;m still sleeping with the mangroves and the ibis, under a masterpiece of stars. The comet&#x2019;s tail a brushstroke of pure, genius light.<br><br>These are more than memories. They are what lives&#x2014;and relives&#x2014;inside our bodies, in every cell and heartbeat. The undiscovered DNA of our souls imprinted with the minute details of those eternal moments that change our lives, our stories, forever. Sometimes they&#x2019;re subtle, sometimes dramatic, but we know nothing will ever be the same the instant we experience them. And quite often they are unexpected.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>On the afternoon of December 12, while casually driving back to my home in Maine, I receive a phone call with the news that I have been chosen as inaugural poet. Bewildered, I first wonder if it could be some cruel joke a friend might be playing on me. <i>You mean like Robert Frost? Like Maya Angelou?</i> I ask, wanting confirmation that what I just heard is true. <i>Yes. Yes</i>, I&#x2019;m told, as I keep driving down the interstate in a daze, trying to speak, trying to fathom what has just happened. But I know. My body knows it&#x2019;s the most important moment of my life as a poet, a day by which I will mark the rest of my life, the day I learned that I will be named the fifth poet ever in our history to be US Inaugural Poet.<br><br> I&#x2019;m asked by the Presidential Inaugural Committee to write not one but <i>three</i> poems in three weeks. Quite a challenge. But before any apprehension or pressure sets in, the world I move through is transfixed by my jubilation and astonishment: one by one the birches along the highway turn from silver to gold; the bare-branched oaks traced with snow become perfectly balanced sculptures; and the highway stretches right into the sun. I begin the poem in my mind as I drive, musing over a flood of lines and images.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> But then I catch my eyes in the rearview mirror, and it becomes a portal into my past. In my reflection I see my father holding my hand for the last time, as he is quietly dying in the spare room of the house where he raised me. His eyes blink forever once: <i>goodbye</i>; twice: <i>forgive me</i>; three times: <i>I won&#x2019;t be back</i>. Gone, into the space beyond the sun and stars. I think of him, my mother, my grandparents&#x2014;their courage and sacrifices, all their struggles and hard work to make a better life in America for themselves and for my brother and me. Overcome by a wave of immense gratitude, I pull off the highway, step out of the car, and sit on the shoulder, leaning against the car door. Looking into the sky, the sun becomes a sunflower again. <i>This is because of them</i> . . . I keep thinking and repeating . . . <i>because of them</i> . . . <i>all because of them</i> . . .</p><h2>Looking at Type in the Workplace</h2><p><p>Over your lifetime, you will spend between 50,000 to 100,000 hours at work, more than any other activity.

When she stepped out of the Pueblo Caliente courthouse, all she was thinking about was the work she had to get caught up on. Then her attention was caught by a fight between a couple that looked like it was about to turn ugly. <br><br>But ugly didn't even begin to cover it when the "man" suddenly transformed into a huge, winged monster right out of a grade Z science fiction movie and went on a deadly killing spree. In hindsight, Kitty realized she probably should have panicked and run screaming the way everyone around her was doing. Instead she sprinted into action to take down the alien.<br><br> In the middle of all the screeching and the ensuing chaos, a hunk in an Armani suit suddenly appeared beside her, introduced himself as Jeff Martini with "the agency," and then insisted on leading her to a nearby limo to talk to his "boss." And that was how Kitty's new life among the aliens began...<br><br><i>Touched by an Alien</i> is the thrilling first installment of the <i>Alien</i> novels.</p><p><b>Gini Koch</b>&nbsp;writes the fast, fresh and funny Alien/Katherine &#x201c;Kitty&#x201d; Katt series for DAW Books, the Necropolis Enforcement Files, and the Martian Alliance Chronicles.

The few bad guys who turn superpowered always have some fatal flaw that renders them easy pickings for the good guys, who also manage to outnumber the baddies every time it matters.<br> &nbsp;<br> In real life, of course, it never works that way. At all.<br> &nbsp;<br> In real life, there are no superheroes. <br> &nbsp;<br> Of course, this doesn&#x2019;t mean there are no superpowered beings. <br> &nbsp;<br> But never fear&#x2014;�I&#x2019;m on it. <br> &nbsp;<br> Yeah, it doesn&#x2019;t sound all that comforting to me, either. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1</b><br> MY FIRST SUPERBEING WAS AN ACCIDENT. Literally and figuratively.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was walking from the courthouse to the parking ga�rage. Jury duty was over, I&#x2019;d been released early, right after the lunch break, so I was free to go back to work and try to catch up on my missed half a day. <br> &nbsp;<br> The parking garage was across the street, so I had to wait for the light. As I stood there hoping I wouldn&#x2019;t sun�burn, I witnessed a small fender bender. One slow-mov�ing car rear-ended another right in front of the courthouse, about fifty feet away from me.<br> &nbsp;<br> The drivers got out&#x2014;�man from the front car, woman from the rear&#x2014;�and he started yelling at her immediately. At first I figured he was raging because he&#x2019;d been hit and the start of summer in Arizona always makes everyone here a little crazy, but I could hear him, and it dawned on me that this was his wife.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was apologizing, but he wasn&#x2019;t having any of it, so she got mad, too. Their fight escalated into shouting in a matter of moments. This was a full-on domestic dispute, the kind the cops rightly want nothing to do with.<br> &nbsp;<br> The light changed, and I wondered if I should just head across the street to avoid getting involved with these two when it happened. The man&#x2019;s rage went supernova, and all of a sudden he sprouted wings out of his back.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m not talking little wings, either. They were huge, eas�ily six and a half feet high and I guessed the span as dou�ble. They had feathers, but they were odd looking, which, I know, you&#x2019;d figure would be a given in the first place. But they didn&#x2019;t look like bird feathers&#x2014;�they gleamed, and not with blood. There was a viscous substance on them, and as I watched, the man turned toward his horrified, scream�ing wife and shot blades out of the feathers that lined the wings&#x2019; edges.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was cut to ribbons in a matter of seconds, and he turned toward the courthouse and let more blades fly. The main Pueblo Caliente courthouse, a nine-story building with mostly glass walls, was built a few years ago and was really very modern and attractive, doing its best to pretend the city hadn&#x2019;t once been a pioneer cow town. <br> &nbsp;<br> I flinched as the projectiles hit. Glass shattered and flew everywhere&#x2014;�the courthouse went from sleek to rubble in a matter of moments. I could hear screams&#x2014;�the people com�ing out of the courthouse, those near the windows in the first few floors, anyone in his path, maybe more&#x2014;were all being cut down, possibly murdered by this man. I couldn&#x2019;t guess how far the projectiles went; for all I knew, they were going deep into the building.<br> &nbsp;<br> I don&#x2019;t know why I didn&#x2019;t try to run or hide. In hindsight, I could say maybe I just knew it would be futile. But at the time, that wasn&#x2019;t what I was thinking. I was scared, but more, I was angry, and I just wanted to stop him. He wasn&#x2019;t slowing the attack at all, and I realized he was enjoying it, enjoying the power, the fear, the death. <br> &nbsp;<br> His back was still to me, and I could see a spot, right be�tween where his shoulder blades had been and wings now were. Something was there, pulsing, almost like a human heart, but it didn&#x2019;t look like a heart. It resembled a small jellyfish, really. <br> &nbsp;<br> I tried to think of what I could use to stop this monster&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t as though they equipped marketing managers with Uzis. I didn&#x2019;t take my eyes off the pulsing thing on the man&#x2019;s back as I dug through my purse and my fingers found my weapon&#x2014;�my heavy, expensive Mont Blanc pen. It had been a gift from my father when I&#x2019;d gotten a promotion at work. I doubted this was what he&#x2019;d hoped I&#x2019;d use it for, but I wasn&#x2019;t holding any other options. <br> &nbsp;<br> I dropped my purse, kicked off my heels, and ran, straight for his back. He was moving closer to the courthouse but was still less than a hundred feet away from me, and back in school I&#x2019;d been on the track team. I was a sprinter and a hurdler, and some things don&#x2019;t leave you, even if you haven&#x2019;t done them for a while.<br> &nbsp;<br> Because he was a little taller than me, I knew I needed to be airborne when I hit him. I judged it and leaped at the last possible moment. My pen slammed into that jelly�fish-like thing on his back just as he started to turn. I could see his eyes&#x2014;�they were wide, glowed red, and no longer looked human.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I drove the pen into his back, his mouth opened, but he didn&#x2019;t make a sound. His eyes, however, went back to human, and they glazed as I watched them die. Then his body fell forward and mine with it. I scrambled to my feet, covered with ooze from his wings and the exploded jelly�fish thing. <br> &nbsp;<br> The police arrived. After all, many of them had been in�side the courthouse. The scene was chaos&#x2014;�people scream�ing, glass and blood everywhere, sirens in the distance&#x2014;�but as I stared down at the dead body, all I could think about was whether I should retrieve my pen or not.<br> &nbsp;<br> A man appeared out of nowhere. He was over six feet, big and broad. I didn&#x2019;t register much else, other than his suit, which I was pretty sure was Armani and looked excel�lent on him, meaning he probably wasn&#x2019;t with the police. My eyes were drawn back to my pen, still sticking out of the dead man&#x2019;s back.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How did you know what to do?&#x201d; he asked, without any opening formalities.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It just seemed . . . right,&#x201d; I answered, winning the Lame Reply Award of the hour. &#x201c;Can I take my pen out?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He squatted down and examined the body. He pulled the pen out slowly. I got the impression he was ready to ram it back in if the body gave the slightest indication of coming back to life.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I saw his eyes. They weren&#x2019;t normal, and then, as I killed him, they went back to human again. And I saw him die,&#x201d; I added. I wondered if I was going to have hysterics and realized I wasn&#x2019;t. I was somewhat relieved.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man looked up at me. I registered his face now&#x2014;rather broad features, strong chin, light-brown eyes, dark, wavy hair. Handsome, definitely. I hated myself for it, but I looked immediately to his left hand. No ring. I looked right back at his face, but he&#x2019;d noticed and grinned. &#x201c;Jeff Martini. Single. No current girlfriend. And you are?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wondering if I&#x2019;m going to be arrested.&#x201d; I noted several of Pueblo Caliente&#x2019;s finest bearing down on us with a de�termined attitude.<br> &nbsp;<br> Martini stood up. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d; He turned around. &#x201c;Our agency will handle it, gentlemen. Please perform crowd control.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The cops all stopped and did what he said, no argu�ments, no issues. I felt nervous now, much more than I had before.<br> &nbsp;<br> He turned back to me. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; As he said this, a large gray limo with tinted windows pulled up across the street. Martini took my arm and led me over. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I need to get my car,&#x201d; I protested. &#x201c;And my shoes.&#x201d; I hopped from foot to foot. I contemplated standing on top of Martini&#x2019;s shoes, then figured the brevity of our relation�ship probably meant I shouldn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Give me the keys,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d; I pulled my arm out of his grasp and managed to find a tiny patch of shade to stand in. &#x201c;What the hell is going on?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> An older man got out of the back of the limo. He was built like Martini but was at least two decades older. They didn&#x2019;t look related, but I was pretty sure they were in the same line of work&#x2014;�whatever that was.<br> &nbsp;<br> He gave me a long look. &#x201c;Give Jeffrey your car keys, please. You&#x2019;re wasting time, ours and yours.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then I get to sleep with the fishes?&#x201d; I asked with as much sarcasm as I could muster.<br> &nbsp;<br> He laughed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not the Mob, we&#x2019;re an authorized world-government agency. You can stay here and be ques�tioned by the police about the death of that unfortunate, or you can come with us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll tell me what happened? I mean, what really happened?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; He moved aside and indicated the car&#x2019;s interior. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll also help you get cleaned up and keep you out of the papers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t move toward the limo or to get my purse.<br> &nbsp;<br> He sighed. &#x201c;We need agents. Ours is a dangerous job. And it&#x2019;s a rare thing when a civilian not only has the cour�age to do what&#x2019;s needed but also the natural instinct to know where and how to kill a superbeing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I felt a nudge, and as I looked around, Martini handed me my purse. He had my shoes as well. &#x201c;Pickpocketing part of the trade?&#x201d; I asked as he tossed my car keys to another man who&#x2019;d appeared out of pretty much nowhere. Same Armani-clad look, maybe a bit smaller in build, but still obviously one of the crew. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I fit the agency&#x2019;s look,&#x201d; I added as I grabbed my shoes and put them back on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Martini grinned again. He had great teeth and a great smile. I was already disgusted with myself for looking for a wedding ring and more now that I was paying attention to his looks while I was possibly teetering on the edge of life or death.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We can use some female intuition,&#x201d; Martini said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what it was, right? You didn&#x2019;t know what was going on, but you knew what to do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I shrugged. &#x201c;I have no idea. Can I have my pen back?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Martini laughed. &#x201c;Only if you get into the car with us.&#x201d; He leaned down. &#x201c;And only if you tell me your name,&#x201d; he whispered in my ear.<br> My knees went weak then. Somehow, this made it all real, not something I&#x2019;d wake up from in a moment. I felt myself blacking out, felt Martini catch me and lift me into his arms, and then . . . nothing.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 2</b><br> I WOKE UP INSIDE THE CAR. I was sitting up, leaning against someone who had his arm around me. Even the confusion of waking up from fainting didn&#x2019;t cause me to wonder whose arm it was. That I didn&#x2019;t mind made me want to turn myself over to Gloria Steinem as a real failure as a modern woman.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;. . . think she&#x2019;ll be willing to be an agent?&#x201d; It was a man&#x2019;s voice, but not Martini&#x2019;s and not the older man&#x2019;s, either. I kept my eyes closed and tried not to change my breathing too much.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hope so.&#x201d; This was Martini. &#x201c;Be nice to have someone easy on the eyes around.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Jeffrey, this isn&#x2019;t a dating service.&#x201d; This was the older man. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better hope she doesn&#x2019;t slam that pen of hers into your groin when she comes to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t give it back to her yet,&#x201d; Martini said with a laugh. I could feel him move a bit. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t wait to find out why she used this.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was all I had.&#x201d; I opened my eyes to see him holding my pen out to the others in the car. I snatched it out of his hand. It was still covered with slime.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m more interested in how you knew where to stick it.&#x201d; The third man&#x2019;s voice. I looked around and realized Martini and I were facing the back of the car, Martini across from the older man, me across from this one. He was built along the same lines as Martini and the older man&#x2014;�big, handsome, and Armani-clad. He was also bald, and his skin was the kind of black that looks almost ebony.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All the men handsome in this agency?&#x201d; I asked the older man. &#x201c;Because, if so, trust me when I say I can help you recruit all the women you want.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Mr. White.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Right. And he&#x2019;s Mr. Black?&#x201d; I said, indicating the man across from me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Great sense of humor,&#x201d; the black man said dryly. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m Paul Gower. But thanks for the compliment. His name really is White. Richard White. Don&#x2019;t call him Dick.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Unless he acts like one?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not even then,&#x201d; Gower said with a small smile. &#x201c;Now, you going to impress us with your manners and tell us your name?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m sure you all went through my purse while I was out.&#x201d; I looked up at Martini who contrived to look inno�cent. &#x201c;Right. So, you know who I am.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Actually, you woke up before I could find your wallet,&#x201d; Martini admitted. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how you found that pen; your purse is like a black hole.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I prefer to think of it as Mary Poppins&#x2019; carpetbag. Okay, okay,&#x201d; I added to the looks I was getting from both White and Gower. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Katherine Katt, k-a-t-t, and yes, before you ask the obvious, my parents call me Kitty.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I like it,&#x201d; Martini said with a sly grin.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do your friends call you?&#x201d; Gower asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> I gave him a long look. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not my friends yet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> White chuckled. &#x201c;Fair enough, Miss Katt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, let&#x2019;s call her Miss Kitty,&#x201d; Martini pleaded.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wiped the slime on my pen off on his pants. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not gracing that with a response.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My God, I think I&#x2019;m in love,&#x201d; Martini said with a laugh. But he didn&#x2019;t take his arm from around my shoulders.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet you say that to every girl who stabs some weirdo with a pen.&#x201d; I tried not to think about the fact I liked his arm around me. There was more going on, and I had to stop acting as though we were at a singles bar.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only the sexy ones,&#x201d; Martini replied, pretty much wrecking my not-a-singles-bar mind-set. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d have gone with beautiful,&#x201d; Gower said. &#x201c;Women tend to prefer that compliment.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But we want her because she&#x2019;s smart and resourceful,&#x201d; White said, and I could hear something in his tone that sounded like my father&#x2019;s when he&#x2019;d finally had enough and wanted us focused on business.<br> &nbsp;<br> Martini and Gower heard it too, because they stopped bantering and both looked more serious. Me, I didn&#x2019;t care about White&#x2019;s wants.

Valerie Bloomfield's voice rose expectantly. She'd been trying to reach her sister for the past hour with no success.<br><br>"Valerie, where are you?"<br><br>"I'm on a layover in Chicago."

"Norah..." she began.<br><br>"He's doing as well as can be expected."<br><br>"Did you tell him I'm on my way?"

His teaching led thousands to inner freedom from &#34;the dark night of the soul&#34;--the state of spiritual blindness in which most of us live our days, unaware that God is right beside us, in love, in freeing power. Through great opposition and danger, John taught countless men and women how to find freedom in the Spirit.John&#39;s words and deep understanding of spiritual truth will also help you find a richer experience of God, leading you to:a fresh infilling of the love of the Father.renewed wonder at the beauty and holiness of Jesus, our Lord and brother.the discovery of the Holy Spirit&#39;s presence, helping you daily, with new strength and freedom from within.Treasured and classic writings that have had a profound impact on the church down through the ages.</p><p><b>David Hazard</b> is the director of Ascent, an author, a publishing consultant, and a writing and creativity coach. For more information, see his website, www.itsyourlifebethere.com.As editor of a remarkable new series entitled "Rekindling the Inner Fire," David Hazard is reintroducing classic Christian authors to today's readers. In Spirit, he offers us St. John of the Cross, one of the foremost mystics of the Christian faith. Designed perfectly for Lenten reading, the book is organized into 40 readings culled from the great works of this 16th-century Spanish mystic (some of the finest in Christian literature-Dark Night of the Soul, etc.) and paraphrased by Hazard to make the materials more accessible and applicable to a contemporary reader. Each selection is preceded by appropriate scripture passages and followed by a thoughtful prayer reflecting upon the reading. A word of warning: the spirituality espoused by John of the Cross is not the sweet, comfortable spirituality currently in vogue. For example, John would no doubt find the contemporary concern with self-esteem a matter of grasping pride. John's call instead is to self-denial and true knowledge of God-after the sin and untruth have been burned away from our souls.

Have you ever disregarded a hunch that was later proved as fact? Have you ever had a dream . . . and watched it come true? If prayer is about talking to God, Signs and Wonders is about listening for God&#39;s answers. Albert Clayton Gaulden, founder and director of the Sedona Intensive, believes that God speaks to us personally in a language that is rich in symbol and coincidence, offering messages and guidance we can put to use every day to solve our problems and gain peace, joy, and direction. In Signs and Wonders, Gaulden teaches us how to open ourselves up to the language of God, and open ourselves to a more meaningful life. How can we listen to God? How can God help us to understand the answers to our prayers? How can we learn to ward off worry, fear, doubt, and despair? Signs and Wonders contains practical strategies, anecdotes, case studies, and stories of personal transformation that can help us to clear God&#39;s channel - the way we listen - and master a new form of communication. For when we learn to be receptive to God&#39;s language, we can begin to benefit from its grace.</p><p><b>Albert Clayton Gaulden,</b> founder and director of Sedona, Arizona's popular alternative therapy program, the Sedona Intensive, is also the author of <i>Clearing for the Millennium</i> and <i>Signs and Wonders.

What Do You Feel?</b><p>When Susan received word that she had been admitted to both Harvard University and Brown University, she asked her father for help in making the choice. "Both schools are excellent," he said, "but I think you should sleep on the decision." No sooner had he said the words than the doorbell rang. At the door was a deliveryman who said he was lost and needed directions. He was wearing a sweatshirt that carried one word in large crimson type: Harvard.</p><p>David was restless. Things weren't going well for him at work and with a big client meeting the next day, he was finding it difficult to sleep. Staring at the ceiling at 4 a.m., he was overcome by a powerful urge to turn on the radio. Following his intuition, he clicked a button and heard Bob Marley's voice chanting over and over again, "Everything is gonna be all right, everything is gonna be all right." Calmed by the rhythm, he fell back to sleep.</p><p>Barreling along in pouring rain, Michael was lost on an unfamiliar road. He had just been to the doctor's office to get his test results and the news was not good. "Please, God, help me," he was pleading over and over in his head. "If there's anything else I can do, please show me the way." The screeching siren that pierced his thoughts came from a police car pulling Michael over to the side of the road. Despite the light beaming out from the officer's flashlight, Michael was still able to see the billboard in the background, which read, Miracles Can Happen. Do Not Despair.</p><p>Are these coincidences? Signs? Messages? In my opinion, all of the above. I believe God was speaking to Susan, to David, and to Michael in the new language; that is, God's mother tongue, the way He's been talking to us since Biblical times.</p><p>Going as far back as Moses and the burning bush, God has been using sign language to get through to us. In the Bible story that is told in Exodus, Moses was tending his flock in the desert when he came to the mountain of Horeb. Now, in my opinion, Moses must have been a very clever fellow, because when God showed him a burning bush in the middle of the desert, he didn't miss a beat -- Moses knew that God was speaking and wanted him to help set the Israelites free.</p><p>When Noah, his family, and the animals marched off the ark after forty days and forty nights of rain, God sent a rainbow as a covenant between Him and the souls who would replenish the earth. Noah understood. Later on, Abraham saw a ram as he was about to sacrifice his son Isaac and knew God had other plans.</p><p>After Biblical times, organized religions began springing up around the world. I believe this may be when the direct connection between God and mankind was interrupted. As early religions took root, the power became concentrated in a few hands. A hierarchy was established, with priests, rabbis, seers, and others acting as middlemen between God and us. The power brokers and other self-anointed intermediaries clearly enjoyed telling the rest of the folks what to think and what to do. A great many man-made rules and dogmas were established, and in no time people were down on their knees reciting the "right" prayers at the "right" time of day -- as if God were an obsessive-compulsive ego who kept a tight schedule. The God who had made man in His divine image must have had a real chuckle as He watched man remaking Him along human lines. Did God stop talking because man wasn't listening? It's hard to know, but there seems to have been a suppression of the language. Church and state were virtually the same for thousands of years, and people in fear for their lives became parrots to the position of whatever government or religious institution was in power.</p><p>As time moved on, the Western world was plunged into the Dark Ages. During this 1,000-year stretch, none save Joan of Arc reported getting any news from God -- and she came to an unenviable fate. While Joan was being tied to the stake and torched, most people were off fighting holy wars that meant death and havoc for millions of others.</p><p>When the Enlightenment arrived in the seventeenth century, the rational mind was emphasized, giving way to the rise of science. There is no denying that science has brought tremendous advances to health care and the workplace -- we owe so much to conveniences and technology. However, most scientists are absolutely useless when it comes to the spiritual needs of society, perhaps because they can't test, measure, or dissect them. Truth for them has to be weighed and tabulated. Launching the technological revolution, the scientists put machines first. They substituted the rhythm of the machine for the rhythm of the soul. Anyone who has seen the great Charlie Chaplin movie <i>Modern Times</i> will know what I mean. A man on the assembly line becomes a slave to the clock.</p><p>After the assembly line, the conveyor belt, and the atom bomb came the revival in the 1970s of nineteenth-century Prussian philosopher Frederich Nietzsche's declamation that "God is dead," which may have unwittingly triggered the fighting spirit in the rest of us to discover our true spirituality. Our soul was crying out to recover.</p><p>And, in fact, we are recovering. The shift is now occurring. Since the middle of the twentieth century, when the human-potential movement began, we have been searching to find our way back to God. Fueled by a deep and unsatisfied craving, an awareness that the power must pass from the few to the many has been growing. Many of us want to control our own spiritual destiny, even if we enjoy participating in spiritual community and worship. On a very intuitive level, we want to have our own conversation with God, a more direct tie as Moses had. Spurred on by Freud and Jung, who deepened our self-knowledge, we have figured out that if we tame the ego we can become our very best selves, our spiritual selves, and be in an ongoing dialogue with the wonderful God who is there to help and guide us.</p><p>With His incredible sense of timing, God knows that the shift is taking place and He is aware of the window of opportunity that opened with the dawn of the new millennium. Ever ready to welcome us back, God has a whole repertory of techniques He is using to get our attention. He uses so-called coincidences and synchronicities -- unplanned interactions between two or more people -- and His messages are carried to us at very important moments in books and billboards, in poems and on the radio. God finds us where we live and He is definitely multimedia. Some may say this is all wild and crazy wishful thinking, the product of my vivid imagination. But I will tell you that to dismiss what I'm saying is to miss out on an extraordinary relationship with God that can bring you guidance, strength, and peace of mind.</p><p></p><b>Pain and Suffering</b><p>Humans are the souls who choose to come to earth to learn and grow by taking on a physical body. Earth is a school with stiff requirements for the souls who make the trip. First of all, every soul has a lesson plan, and pain and suffering are the teachers. Nobody on earth escapes heartache. Pain seems to be the hallmark of the human condition. But if you stop and think about it, pain can be a blessing in disguise. Pain tests our attitudes. It often sneaks up on us and strikes when we least expect it. Will we be models of optimism like Michael J. Fox, who called his autobiography about living with Parkinson's disease <i>Lucky Man?</i> Or will we allow adversity to crush us? We have a choice.</p><p>Pain provides us with an opportunity to discover our strengths, to help us stretch and grow, to realize that we are spiritual beings with great powers. If we are anything like one of my favorite characters, Dorothy in <i>The Wizard of Oz,</i> the pain helps us to realize there's no place like home. Through suffering, we reach out for help and try to get back to the source.</p><p></p><b>Divine Energy</b><p>Mrs. Schuler, who taught Sunday School when I was a boy growing up in Baptist Birmingham, had some very fixed views about God. She conveyed an impression of God as an old man with a long, white beard sitting in a big gold throne holding the Judgment book in His hand. Those who see God this way have my respect, but my vision has changed dramatically in my six decades of life. I now see God as a vortex of energy -- pure, powerful, and the source of all life, including our own. Being of God makes each of us an indestructible bit of divine energy -- a soul, if you will.</p><p>In the earth school, where pain is the teacher, energy is the unifying force. Energy is not only the basis of all solid matter -- it's also the substance out of which all of our emotions and thoughts are made. That's why it is so important to be mindful of what we think and feel, to be constructive with our thoughts and emotions, and not let grievances and ill intentions hang over us. The tiny, energetic pulses radiating out of our hearts and our minds can carry a positive or a negative charge. That charge influences both the force field around us as well as the larger universe.</p><p>Einstein said we live in an energy universe, and, of course, we do. Matter is energy slowed down, and massive energy is released when the smallest particles of matter are divided. Each human being is a divinely charged energy system, part of God's cosmic design. When you share what is in your heart with someone else, there is an energy exchange as emotions pass between two people. When you make love, that, too, is an energy exchange, an intermingling of force fields. Energy is also involved in some of life's darker transactions. When one person manipulates another person, that is an energy grab. Perhaps you've met an energy vampire -- someone you feel sucks you dry each time you meet or talk. Energy is really at the bottom of a great many activities because that is God's design and we are His work of art.</p><p>The new language, God's language, is also an energy system -- a divine one -- that can be useful in encouraging us, making us feel connected, and steering us in the right direction. Our task is to engage the energy flow. As we ...</p></p><h2>A Well of Wonder: C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, and The Inklings (Mount Tabor Books)</h2><p><b>Clyde S.

Haanel was born on May 22, 1866 in Ann Arbor, Michigan to Hugo and Emeline Haanel. He started his business career as an office boy for a company in St. Louis at which he stayed for fifteen years. Yearning for a better life, he resigned his position in order to start his own company. In 1898, Mr. Haanel convinced investors that Tehuantepee, New Mexico would be a prime place to initiate the growth of sugar and coffee. He was made president of this venture. From the start it was successful. It grew in value greatly and made all of the investors and Haanel wealthy. Mr. Haanel formed the Continental Commercial Company in 1905, which included the sugar and coffee plantation as well as six additional companies that were absorbed into the whole. At the time, it was one of the largest conglomerates in the world with a value of $2.5 million. Building upon those successes, Mr. Haanel formed many other companies that added to his wealth: The Sacramento Valley Improvement Company, vineyards, and a mining company. He was president of all the ventures and was responsible for their success and growth. Mr. Haanel married Miss Esther M. Smith in 1885 and had one son and two daughters. His wife died in 1901 and in 1908 he remarried to Miss Margaret Nicholson. According to sources, his daughters are still living. Beside his business interests, Mr. Haanel was a member of the Keystone lodge, the Authors&#x2019; League of America, the American Society of Psychical Research, the St. Louis Humane Society, the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce, and the Science League of America. He was a thirty-second degree Mason, a Shriner, and a member of the Missouri Athletic Club, as well. According to a short biography of him (from which much of this article derived its facts) in St. Louis&#x2014;History of the Fourth City by Walter B. Stevens, "He is a man of mature judgement, capable of taking a calm survey of life and correctly valuing its opportunities, its possibilities, its demands and obligations." Mr. Haanel died on November 27, 1949 at the age of 83. He was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery, St. Louis. By taking an overview of Mr. Haanel&#x2019;s life, it becomes clear how the tenets written in The Master Key System guided Mr. Haanel.

It affects more than just your outlook on life; it can affect your well-being as well. Many chronic ailments are not the result of germs or genes but are rooted in our emotional biology. The link between emotional type and health explains why modern medicine--which views treatment as &#x201c;one size fits all&#x201d;--often fails to successfully treat chronic pain and illness. <br> <br>Examining the interplay of emotions, chronic illness and pain, and treatment success, Michael Jawer and Dr. Marc Micozzi reveal how chronic conditions are intrinsically linked to certain emotional types and how these ailments are best treated by choosing a healing therapy in line with your type. Explaining the emotional ties behind the 12 most common chronic illnesses--asthma, allergies, chronic fatigue, depression, fibromyalgia, hypertension, irritable bowel syndrome, migraines, post-traumatic stress disorder, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcers--the authors provide an easy assessment survey that allows you to identify your emotional type as well as the ailments to which you are susceptible. Extending this connection between mind and body, they assess 7 alternative healing therapies--acupuncture, hypnosis, biofeedback, meditation, yoga, guided imagery, and relaxation techniques--and indicate which methods work best for each emotional type. Empowering you as a patient to seek out the therapies that will work best for you, this book offers a welcome path to effective pain relief and sustainable health. <br> <br>MICHAEL A.

Cowans is one of the great unrecognized photographic luminaries of our time, and this magnificent book is a fitting and long-awaited tribute to his immense talent. Personal Vision follows Cowans's photographic evolution from Navy photographer to apprentice to the great Gordon Parks to history-shaping documenter of 1960s Harlem to a high-profile Hollywood portrait photographer with a larger-than-life clientele list, including Al Pacino, Jane Fonda, Katherine Hepburn, and Mick Jagger. Cowan's images embody 1960s documentary style, street journalism, portraiture and self-portrayals, still-lifes, and experimental work. Personal Vision captures the evolution and expansive talent of a single photographer who had access to worlds as diverse as Harlem street life and high-fashion models, and who continues to photograph today with gusto and imagination, creating one of the major archives of a living American photographer, seen here for the first time in an expansive collection.</p><p><br></p><br><p></p></p><p><p>Adger Cowans studied photography at Ohio State University under Clarence H.

The tome contains 40 years of photographs &#x2015; including Malcolm X at a rally on Fifth Avenue, Halle Berry and Al Pacino on set, and portraits of Gordon Parks. (Lena Rawley <i>New York Magazine, January 24, 2017</i>)<br><br>'Personal Vision' attests to Mr. Cowans' mastery, featuring a broad range of photographic subjects... Pulsing with the heartbeat of their subjects, these images make visible that which is often unseen: the complex humanity that defines each of us, making us far more similar than different... Mr. Cowans' production has been prodigious. (Maurice Berger <i>The New York Times, December 20, 2016</i>)<br><br>Over the course of a long career that included an apprenticeship with Gordon Parks, a run as a successful magazine portraitist and film set photographer and a longstanding interest in fine art, Adger Cowans has been driven by the desire to capture emotion... [Personal Vision] celebrates the span of his work, from street studies to portraits of creators ranging from Romare Bearden, pictured with his cat, to Mick Jagger napping in a hammock. (<i>PDN, January 15, 2017</i>)<br><br>"Asked what he has meant to the world of photography, Cowans replied, 'I don't think like that. Spirit touches me and something comes out. It belongs with the world, it doesn't belong with me.'" (Michelle Miller <i>CBS</i>)<br><br>"Mr. Cowans also paints, makes music, and works with fiber, bolstering his Renaissance Man stature. The book riffs on that distinction, showing different phases of his photography discretely, including digital concoctions, still lives, and experimental imagery." (Jonathan Blaustein <i>A Photo Editor, March 3, 2017</i>)<br><br>Perhaps the best way to describe Cowans work is to speak of its soul, of its capturing and encapsulating the ineffable, intangible, ephemeral yet eternal, essence of life, one that is as ethereal in spirit as it is tangible in silver gelatin printing.

Social supports have been cut, while corporations have achieved record profits. Downward mobility has produced political backlash.</p><p>What is going on? <em>Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism?</em> argues that neither trade nor immigration nor technological change is responsible for the harm to workers&#x2019; prospects. According to Robert Kuttner, global capitalism is to blame. By limiting workers&#x2019; rights, liberating bankers, allowing corporations to evade taxation, and preventing nations from assuring economic security, raw capitalism strikes at the very foundation of a healthy democracy.</p><p>The resurgence of predatory capitalism was not inevitable. After the Great Depression, the U.S. government harnessed capitalism to democracy. Under Roosevelt&#x2019;s New Deal, labor unions were legalized, and capital regulated. Well into the 1950s and &#x2019;60s, the Western world combined a thriving economy with a secure and growing middle class.</p><p>Beginning in the 1970s, as deregulated capitalism regained the upper hand, elites began to dominate politics once again; policy reversals followed. The inequality and instability that ensued would eventually, in 2016, cause disillusioned voters to support far-right faux populism. Is today&#x2019;s poisonous alliance of reckless finance and ultranationalism inevitable? Or can we find the political will to make capitalism serve democracy, and not the other way around? Charting a plan for bold action based on political precedent, <em>Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism?</em> is essential reading for anyone eager to reverse the decline of democracy in the West.</p></p><p>Robert Kuttner, cofounder and coeditor of the American Prospect, is a former columnist for BusinessWeek, the Washington Post, and the Boston Globe. He holds the Ida and Meyer Kirstein Chair at Brandeis University, and lives in Boston.&#x201c;Democracies govern nations, while global capitalism runs the world. Robert Kuttner provides a clear-eyed, intellectually riveting account of how the inevitable tensions between the two have fueled neofascist nationalism here and abroad, and why the response must be a new progressive populism rooted in democracy and social justice. Timely and compelling.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert B. Reich, chancellor&#x2019;s professor of public policy, University of California at Berkeley</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Robert Kuttner combines economic acumen, a gift for narrative, and genuine passion in his persuasive new book. In his telling, the issue isn&#x2019;t whether national economies should be open to foreign trade or finance. It&#x2019;s whether the rules of the global economy are set up to benefit?ordinary citizens or merely economic elites.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jacob S. Hacker,&nbsp;Yale University and coauthor of <em>Winner-Take-All Politics</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Kuttner brilliantly brings together two strands of thought: explaining both the economics and politics of global capitalism and how our society has abandoned core principles of fairness and equality. The rise of inequality helped pave the way for Donald Trump&#x2015;a figure out of step with basic American values. Kuttner reminds us of the urgency with which we need to get back to a more just society.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joseph E. Stiglitz, Columbia University, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics and best-selling author of <em>The Price of Inequality</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Standing on the shoulders of Karl Polanyi, Bob Kuttner revives the lost art of political economy in this absorbing and important&nbsp;analysis of wild markets, assaults on labor, and profound changes to institutional rules.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ira Katznelson, Columbia University and author of the Bancroft Prize&#x2013;winning&nbsp;<em>Fear Itself: The New Deal and the Origins of Our Time</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Democracy is no longer writing the rules for capitalism; instead it is the other way around. With his deep insight and wide learning, Kuttner is among our best guides for understanding how we reached this point and what&#x2019;s at stake if we stay on our current path.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Heather McGhee, president of Demos</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Conventional wisdom has it that our income disparities and dysfunctional politics are the consequence of inexorable and uncontrollable developments in technology, market competition, and globalization.&nbsp;As Robert Kuttner argues in this superb book, they are instead the result of our own policy choices.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dani Rodrik, Harvard University and author of <em>Straight Talk on Trade</em> and <em>The Globalization Paradox</em></strong></p><h2>How to Speak Midwestern</h2><p>Pittsburgh toilet, squeaky cheese, city chicken, shampoo banana, and Chevy in the Hole are all phrases that are familiar to Midwesterners but sound foreign to anyone living outside the region. This book explains not only what Midwesterners say but also how and why they say it and covers such topics as: the causes of the Northern cities vowel shift, why the accents in Fargo miss the nasality that&#39;s a hallmark of Minnesota speech, and why Chicagoans talk more like people from Buffalo than their next-door neighbors in Wisconsin. Readers from the Midwest will have a better understanding of why they talk the way they do, and readers who are not from the Midwest will know exactly what to say the next time someone ends a sentence with &#34;eh?&#34;.</p><p><b>Edward McClelland</b> is a journalist.

The widely respected reformed theologian John Piper here assembles an all-star lineup of pastors, teachers, and writers who are also popular public speakers on this topic. Scott Grunden takes on the difficult task of giving voice to six very different speakers but opts for simply reading each lecture in his own voice. This choice does a disservice to the content, as the nuanced delivery style of each speaker is lost. Furthermore, Grunden&#39;s dry run-through of the transcribed conversations at the end of the book begs for vocal differentiation. The subject matter does not suffer though, and this work should inform the listener about much of cutting-edge theology.

It is a waste product and a commodity pricier than oil. It can save lives and transmit deadly infections. Each one of us has roughly nine pints of it, yet many don&#x2019;t even know their own blood type. And for all its ubiquitousness, the few tablespoons of blood discharged by 800 million women are still regarded as taboo: menstruation is perhaps the single most demonized biological event.</p><p>Rose George, author of <i>The Big Necessity</i>, is renowned for her intrepid work on topics that are invisible but vitally important. In <i>Nine Pints</i>, she takes us from ancient practices of bloodletting to the breakthough of the "liquid biopsy," which promises to diagnose cancer and other diseases with a simple blood test. She introduces Janet Vaughan, who set up the world&#x2019;s first system of mass blood donation during the Blitz, and Arunachalam Muruganantham, known as &#x201c;Menstrual Man&#x201d; for his work on sanitary pads for developing countries.

The book jackets reproduced here reflect the changing visual styles and motifs of the passing century, beginning with the Art Deco period and continuing through Modernism, the playful Thirties, the pre- and postwar Neo-Romantics, the new consumerism and realist subject matter of the Fifties, and the Pop Art of the Sixties.</p><p>Featuring talent from the US and UK, <em>Cover Up: The Illustrated Book Jacket</em> explores the pictorial dust jacket through a selection of more than 300 key works and artists that influenced the course of book jacket design.</p> 366 color illustrations</p><p>Martin Salisbury is Professor of Illustration and Director of The Centre for Children&#x2019;s Book Studies at Anglia Ruskin University.

J. Liebling&#x2019;s tongue-in-cheek tour of their fair city in 1952. Liebling found much to admire in the Windy City&#x2019;s people and culture&#x2014;its&nbsp;colorful language, its political sophistication, its sense of its own history and specialness, but Liebling offended that city&#x2019;s image of itself when he discussed its entertainments, its built landscapes, and its mental isolation from the world&#x2019;s affairs. <p>Liebling, a writer and editor for the New Yorker, lived in Chicago for nearly a year. While he found a home among its colorful inhabitants, he couldn&#x2019;t help comparing Chicago with some other cities he had seen and loved, notably Paris, London, and especially New York. His magazine columns brought down on him a storm of protests and denials from Chicago&#x2019;s defenders, and he gently and humorously answers their charges and acknowledges his errors in a foreword written especially for the book edition. Liebling describes the restaurants, saloons, and striptease joints; the newspapers, cocktail parties, and political wards; the university; and the defining event in Chicago&#x2019;s mythic past, the Saint Valentine&#x2019;s Day Massacre. Illustrated by Steinberg, Chicago is a loving, if chiding, portrait of a great American metropolis.</p></p><p>A. J. Liebling (1904&#x2013;63) was a longtime contributor and columnist for the <i>New Yorker</i>. He wrote <i>The Sweet Science</i> and nineteen other books of nonfiction, including <i>Mollie and Other War Pieces</i>, also available in a Bison Books edition. Saul Steinberg was a cartoonist and illustrator best known for his covers and illustrations in the <i>New Yorker</i>."Alex Kotlowitz's <i>Never a City So Real</i> has a different style and tone from A.J. Liebling's 1952 tongue-in-cheek book about Chicago, but they belong on the same elevated bookshelf of Chicago classics. The series in <i>The New Yorker</i> that this book is based on elicited a slew of protests from Chicagoans, which Liebling answers in this witty volume."&#x2014;Elizabeth Taylor, <i>The Chicago Tribune</i> (Elizabeth Taylor <i>The Chicago Tribune</i>)<br><br>"Good entertainment.

In this book, the interested reader will find a variety of hands-on suggestions on how to optimize the design of retail stores and service environments to increase customer satisfaction and sales. While the focus is on the practical applicability of the concepts discussed, the book is nevertheless firmly grounded in consumer and psychological research. In this respect it is uniquely positioned vis-a-vis books written by artists, architects and interior designers which lack a solid research foundation and academic journals articles, which are often inaccessible to the educated yet non-specialized reader. In writing this book, the author draws on both the recent research literature and his own experience as a marketing consultant and consumer researcher. The intended audiences are marketing managers, small business owners and MBA students. Topics covered in the book include: goals and relevance of store design; design tips derived from environmental psychology; cognitive and affective approaches to store design and visual merchandising; use of ambient factors such as music, colors and scents; creation of emotional experiences and theming.</p><p>Claus Ebster is an associate professor of marketing and business administration at the University of Vienna and president of Market Mentor, a consulting company specializing in marketing strategy, consumer research and store design.

T. Bauer argues, economic growth <i>is</i> possible under the right conditions. These include a certain amount of thrift and enterprise among the people, social mores and traditions which sustain them, and a firm but limited government which permits market forces to work. Challenging many views about development that are widely held, Bauer takes on squarely the notion that egalitarianism is an appropriate goal. He goes on to argue that the population explosion of less-developed countries has on the whole been a voluntary phenomenon and that each new generation has lived better than its forebears. He also critically examines the notion that the policies and practices of Western nations have been responsible for third world poverty. In a major chapter, he reviews the rationalizations for foreign aid and finds them weak; while in another he shows that powerful political clienteles have developed in the Western nations supporting the foreign aid process and probably benefiting more from it than the alleged recipients. Another chapter explores the link between the issue of Special Drawing Rights by the International Monetary Fund on the one hand and the aid process on the other.</p><p>Throughout the book, Bauer carefully examines the evidence and the light it throws on the propositions of development. Although the results of his analysis contradict the conventional wisdom of development economics, anyone who is seriously concerned with the subject must take them into account.</p></p><p>P. T.

Bannon a teacher, writer, mom, and grandma. The book shows children how the Eucharist allows them to hold God s hand and opens the door to heaven. She uses the analogy of holding God's hand to emphasize that the more frequently we receive Communion, the more our relationship with Jesus deepens. She points out that kids do not try to rationalize the scientific aspects of transubstantiation they just believe the Eucharist is the Body of Christ. Because, as Carol says, many adults need to rediscover this truth, the book has even been used in adult ministries. Check out the website for some views of the book. It s definitely a great resource for explaining this precious gift to our kids. --Catholic Mommy Brain 2009 Book Review<br><br>A Handshake From Heaven is a children's book that explains with gorgeous pictures and easy-to-read text our connection to Jesus Christ during the acceptance of the Eucharist at our Church ceremony. Most children have simple questions about God, Jesus Christ and the Eucharist. This book helps explain how we touch God every time we accept the Eucharist from our priest, pastor, or Eucharist minister. Michaelin Otis' beautifully drawn illustrations show how we can touch God every day by holding hands with someone we love or interacting with everything around us; including flowers, butterflies and puppies. However, the primary message of the book is the Eucharist and how God opens the door to Heaven every time we experience the Eucharist. A well-written book that has a fantastic fit with first and second graders who are usually approaching their First Communion and need as many materials as they can get that explain the process of the Eucharist and what it really means to attend Mass and accept the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Minimal text on each page makes this a great book for young readers to read on their own. Bannon also makes it clear that it is everyone's own choice to accept Jesus Christ and the Eucharist and the gift we are given when we experience this sacred moment. Armchair Interviews says: Highly recommended for a young audience and even adults that are going through a Christian religious conversion. --Armchair Interviews<br><br>I just wanted to let you know how beautiful your book - A Handshake for Heaven is.

Now McColman is back with <i>Answering the Contemplative Call</i>, to show readers how to apply the riches of the mystical tradition to daily living.</p><p>This book is organized in three sections:<br></p><ul><li>"Recognizing the Call," Explores how each one of us is called to the mystical life, and what that might look like. </li><li> "Preparing for the Journey," shows what we need to do in response to the contemplative call.</li><li>"Embarking on the Adventure" considers what those first steps on the path might look like. </li></ul><p></p><p>Along the way McColman quotes from the great mystics of the Christian tradition who have also traveled this path, including Teresa of Avila, Thomas Merton, Evelyn Underhill and more.</p><p>In <i>Answering the Contemplative Call</i>, McColman offers a practice that will help readers come to a place meaning and purpose in their lives.</p></p><p>Carl McColman is the author of several books, including <i>The Big Book of Christian Mysticism</i>, and writes for the <i>Huffington Post</i> and <i>Patheos.com</i>. He lives in Stone Mountain, GA. Visit him online at www.carlmccolman.com.McColman, a Christian layman who practices contemplative prayer and retreat, offers an accessible guide for those who feel the need to respond to a similar call. He divides his presentation into three stages: recognizing the contemplative call, preparing to follow it, and undertaking it. He writes for an audience that he assumes shares his interest, but he doesn&#x2019;t claim contemplation as either a panacea for all spiritual needs or as specific to Christianity. Relying on historical examples of such famous contemplatives as Teresa of �vila and Augustine of Hippo, McColman also acknowledges how contemplation now is contextualized by a social and scientific world far different from that of the Middle Ages. Ending with a discussion of the community aspects of contemplation, this is a complete handbook that can lend comfort and credence to the felt needs of latter day followers of Thomas Merton.

Here, she upends the feminist agenda and the liberal conversation surrounding women's issues by asking tough and crucial questions, such as: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;Did women's full equality require the total destruction of the nuclear family?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;Did it require a sexual revolution that would dismantle traditions of modesty, courtship, and fidelity that had characterized relations between the sexes for centuries?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;Did it cause the broken dating culture and the rape crisis on our college campuses? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;Did it require war between the sexes that would deem men the "enemy" of women?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;Have the strides of feminism made women happier in their home and work life. (The answer is No.)<br><br><i>Sex Matters </i>tracks the price we have paid for denying sex differences and stoking the war of the sexes--family breakdown, declining female happiness, aimlessness among men, and increasing inequality. Marshaling copious social science research as well as her own experience as a professional as well as a wife and mother, Mona Charen calls for a sexual ceasefire for the sake of women, men, and children.</p><p><b>Mona Charen</b>, one of the most prominent conservative writers in the country, is the author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>Useful Idiots</i>.

Hundreds of prominent men in fields from entertainment to sports to business to politics have been credibly accused of gross sexual harassment and other forms of boorishness. The louts span the political spectrum, from Bill O&#x2019;Reilly and Roger Ailes on the right, to Al Franken and John Conyers Jr. on the left. And the toll continues to mount.</p><p>Young people hardly date much, but they feel pressured into hooking up. Some millennials are giving up on sex altogether. Eighteen-year-old Noah Patterson, a virgin, told the Washington Post that he preferred online porn to having a girlfriend. &#x201c;For an average date, you&#x2019;re going to spend at least two hours, and in that two hours I won&#x2019;t be doing something I enjoy.&#x201d;1</p><p>Teenagers and even some preteens &#x201c;sext&#x201d; one another, and sometimes find themselves facing child pornography charges.2 The percentage of adults who have never been married is at a historic high (30 percent), and fewer than one-third of millennials say that having a successful marriage is &#x201c;one of the most important things in life.&#x201d;3 While many women proclaim themselves &#x201c;single by choice,&#x201d; others express frustration with the lack of marriageable men. In 2011, Kate Bolick described the proliferation of commitment-phobic men, which she believed had created a new &#x201c;dating gap.&#x201d; Marriage-minded women, she wrote, &#x201c;are increasingly confronted with either deadbeats or players.&#x201d;4 The so-called men&#x2019;s rights movement thrives online, encouraging men to see themselves as victims of the sex wars and to luxuriate in misogyny.</p><p>The most talked about cultural products of the past few years only occasionally offer models of nobility or even basic integrity between men and women. They range from rampant adultery (Madmen) to incest and sex slavery (Game of Thrones). In HBO&#x2019;s Girls, the protagonist&#x2019;s &#x201c;boyfriend&#x201d; in the first few episodes is really not a boyfriend at all but a sex partner--and not a very nice one at that. Hannah drops by Adam&#x2019;s apartment and is ordered to remove her clothes, to get on all fours, to stop talking, and to perform a variety of sex acts while he indulges the fantasy that she is a child with a &#x201c;Cabbage Patch lunchbox.&#x201d;</p><p>How did we become so estranged--and so strange? How did love and sex become battlegrounds where feminists decry &#x201c;rape culture&#x201d; while the &#x201c;manosphere&#x201d; hurls vicious insults at women in general?</p><p>Modern feminism, I submit, must take at least some of the blame.</p><p>Feminism deserves credit for helping women get the vote, securing equal pay, and obtaining full civil and political rights. Those are unmixed blessings. No reasonable person questions whether women should be treated as full legal equals to men--that is beyond debate. But did that full equality require the denigration of the nuclear family? Did it require the eager embrace of a sexual revolution that would dismantle the traditions of modesty, courtship, and fidelity that have protected women for centuries? Was it essential to declare a war between the sexes, and to deem men the &#x201c;enemy&#x201d; of women? Was it necessary to seed our culture with bitterness that continues to this day?</p><p>Let&#x2019;s start at the beginning. It is moving to read the pleas for women&#x2019;s equality from Mary Wollstonecraft, the eighteenth-century protofeminist, who argued that women could be rational creatures and deserved to be educated. In A Vindication of the Rights of Women (1792), Wollstonecraft wrote, &#x201c;Let woman share the rights, and she will emulate the virtues of man; for she must grow more perfect when emancipated.&#x201d;5</p><p>The great British philosopher John Stuart Mill declared in the 1869 that &#x201c;the legal subordination of one sex to the other--is wrong itself, and is now one of the chief obstacles to human improvement; and it ought to be replaced by a principle of perfect equality that doesn&#x2019;t allow any power or privilege on one side or disability on the other.&#x201d;6</p><p>In his treatise &#x201c;The Subjection of Women&#x201d; (1869), Mill scoffed at the notion that women were less intelligent than men (a widely held view at the time) and rebutted those who protested that women had achieved little in the arts and sciences. Mill was scornful: &#x201c;Our best novelists have mostly been women,&#x201d; he wrote, mentioning in particular Madame de Sta�l and George Sand. Of the latter, he wrote that it would be impossible to find &#x201c;[a] finer specimen of purely artistic excellence than the prose of Madame Sand, whose style acts on the nervous system like a symphony of Haydn or Mozart.&#x201d;7</p><p>It was fully understandable that women had not achieved excellence in other fields, Mill noted, since they were denied the education men received, and he added that women had original ideas all the time but, lacking the wherewithal to publish or publicly demonstrate their insights, often passed along these ideas to husbands or other male relatives.8 Mill freely acknowledged that &#x201c;a very large proportion indeed&#x201d; of his ideas originated with the women in his life.</p><p>He also explained women&#x2019;s comparatively less prodigious production of original works of art by noting that &#x201c;very few women have time for them. . . . Even when the superintending of a household isn&#x2019;t laborious in other ways, it&#x2019;s a very heavy burden on the thoughts; it requires incessant vigilance, an eye that catches every detail, and it constantly presents inescapable problems to be solved.&#x201d;9 Bravo, Mr. Mill. Too few men appreciate this core female competency.</p><p>In the intervening centuries, women&#x2019;s roles have changed dramatically. In our own time, we&#x2019;ve been encouraged to believe that women&#x2019;s history is one long tale of exploitation and denigration, oppressions that lifted only when feminism arrived to free us. But this narrative always seemed forced to me. Of course, some men have treated some women badly throughout human history. But declaring that all women have been oppressed by all men seems overly simplistic. Relations between the sexes, starting in families, are too complex to reduce to oppressors and victims.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The First Wave You&#x2019;ve Never Heard Of</p><p>Feminism&#x2019;s &#x201c;first wave&#x201d; is usually dated to the late nineteenth century&#x2019;s suffrage movement, though some people agitated for equal rights before then. The suffragists are now included in the feminist pantheon. On the evening before the 2016 presidential election, feminists gathered at Susan B. Anthony&#x2019;s grave, assuming that Hillary Clinton would become the first woman elected president. Anthony has been honored on the U.S. currency, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton&#x2019;s home is a National Park Service site. In April 2016, the Treasury Department announced that Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, and Alice Paul will be featured on the ten-dollar bill to mark the one-hundredth anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment, which enfranchised women coast to coast.</p><p>These women may be the ones most often cited in textbooks, but as the American Enterprise Institute&#x2019;s Christina Hoff Sommers has pointed out, Frances Willard and Hannah More were far more influential and popular with women during the nineteenth century. More (1745&#x2013;1833), an English novelist, poet, political reformer, and pamphleteer, championed what Sommers calls &#x201c;maternal feminism.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t deny differences between the sexes but urged women to use their special abilities to improve the world. Religiously inspired, she founded Sunday schools that taught poor children their ABCs, but also instilled thrift, sobriety, and piety. Her novels and pamphlets excoriated the rich for their amorality, for their hedonism, and for ignoring the needs of the poor.10</p><p>Frances Willard, who founded the Woman&#x2019;s Christian Temperance Union, spoke for many more women than the suffragists. We look back on Prohibition as an idealistic blunder, but women&#x2019;s intensity about the question indicated that they were more concerned about what excessive drinking was doing to families than they were about the right to vote. As Sommers notes, the National American Woman Suffrage Association had only about seven thousand members, though the WCTU could boast one hundred fifty thousand. The women&#x2019;s suffrage movement needed help from the WCTU before it could begin scoring political victories. Like More, Willard embraced women&#x2019;s &#x201c;separate sphere&#x201d; while also believing that women had a duty to improve the world. In addition to temperance, the WCTU lobbied for prison reform, child welfare, and care for the disabled.11</p><p>The women reformers of that time, unlike those who would lead second-wave feminism some decades later, avoided grievance mongering. They saw women&#x2019;s issues as being linked to men&#x2019;s and children&#x2019;s. Though the temperance movement highlighted the damage excessive alcohol use did to wives and children, it also focused on husbands and sons who drank.</p><p>Second-wave feminists, by contrast, would explicitly link women&#x2019;s struggles with the cause of civil rights for African Americans. In 1963&#x2019;s The Feminine Mystique, Betty Friedan declared that &#x201c;What we need is a political movement, a social movement like that of blacks.&#x201d;12</p><p>In a 1969 piece for New York magazine titled &#x201c;After Black Power, Women&#x2019;s Liberation,&#x201d; Gloria Steinem wrote, &#x201c;Finally, women [recognized] their essential second-classness, forming women&#x2019;s caucuses inside the Movement in much the same way Black Power groups had done. And once together[,] they made a lot of discoveries: that they shared more problems with women of different classes, for instance, than they did with men of their own.&#x201d;13</p><p>This is overwrought, particularly when compared to the approach taken by the women leaders of the first wave. The women&#x2019;s suffrage movement did share roots with the movement for abolition. Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Angelina Emily Grimk�, and Sarah Moore Grimk� were prominent abolitionists who also campaigned for women&#x2019;s rights. But suggesting that the condition of women could be compared to that of black slaves or black citizens is a huge leap.</p><p>It has become fashionable for various interest groups to hijack the vocabulary and moral standing of the civil rights movement. Women, Latinos, the handicapped, homosexuals, transgender individuals--all have sought to compare their situations with that of blacks. But no group in American history has suffered the kind of dehumanization, persecution, exclusion, terror, and discrimination that blacks were subjected to for more than three hundred years.</p><p>Even leaving aside slavery, with its incalculable suffering, African Americans were the victims of thousands of lynchings, systematic torture, discrimination, and abuse. In the years between 1883 and 1927, more than three thousand blacks were lynched.14 As historians Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom note, these crimes were designed to terrorize all African Americans. &#x201c;They were not usually the furtive work of masked men wearing sheets, as is sometimes thought. Rather they were highly public events; the perpetrators were not only known to the community but sometimes even posed for &#x2018;before&#x2019; and &#x2018;after&#x2019; photographs in the local paper first with their victim and then with their victim&#x2019;s corpse!&#x201d;15</p><p>Now consider how Steinem described the &#x201c;oppression&#x201d; of women in her 1969 article: &#x201c;[M]ore backstage work, more mimeographing, more secondary role playing around the revolutionary cells and apartment communes. And to be honest, more reluctance to leave the secondary role and lose male approval.&#x201d;16</p><p>Steinem believed women deserved a revolution because &#x201c;subtler, psychological punishments for stepping out of women&#x2019;s traditional &#x2018;service&#x2019; roles were considerable. (Being called &#x2018;unfeminine,&#x2019; &#x2018;a bad mother,&#x2019; &#x2018;a castrating bitch,&#x2019; to name a traditional few.)&#x201d;17</p><p>Or, as one New York woman complained during a consciousness-raising session in 1969, &#x201c;I have to keep reminding myself that there&#x2019;s nothing wrong with body hair, and no reason for one sex to scrape a razor over their legs.&#x201d;18</p><p>Comparing women&#x2019;s &#x201c;plight&#x201d; to what blacks experienced trivialized the true suffering of African Americans, yet feminist-influenced textbooks increasingly stressed this, maintaining that women have been ignored by a &#x201c;patriarchal,&#x201d; man-centered history. One widely used women&#x2019;s studies textbook argued for &#x201c;radical reconceptualizations&#x201d; that would &#x201c;overcome the bias that has been built into what has come to be known as &#x2018;knowledge.&#x2019; &#x201d; Another insisted that &#x201c;traditional systems of knowledge have ignored women altogether or frequently portrayed them in stereotypical or demeaning ways.&#x201d;19</p><p>I was educated before this victim narrative took hold, and accordingly, I learned that American history (and world history, for that matter) is brimming with stories of women who were brilliant, brave, righteous, inventive, and worthy of emulation--as well as treacherous, greedy, cruel, lazy, and insipid. I could never escape the suspicion that women were human beings, with all the virtues and vices of the human condition.</p><p>But cringing victims bent under the weight of patriarchy? I don&#x2019;t think so.</p><p>American women have been at the forefront of many of our country&#x2019;s most momentous reform movements. Anne Hutchinson, a charismatic preacher (and mother of fifteen), provoked a schism among Puritans in seventeenth-century Boston. Harriet Beecher Stowe gave abolitionism its greatest weapon in Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin, while Harriet Tubman helped to run the Underground Railroad. As I&#x2019;ve noted, the temperance movement and Prohibition were primarily the work of the Woman&#x2019;s Christian Temperance Union, led by Frances Willard. Dorothea Dix successfully campaigned to reform the treatment of the mentally ill. Mother Jones was an influential labor activist. Mary Baker Eddy founded the Christian Science church, and Ida Tarbell was a crusading Progressive Era journalist. Jane Addams was a pioneer of urban reform. Rosa Parks helped ignite the struggle for civil rights, and Dorothy Day was a leader of the Catholic Worker Movement. Additionally, millions upon millions of unsung women married, bore children (without anesthesia until quite recently), kept households running, ran businesses, took in boarders, and were the anchors of stable and fulfilling family lives.</p><p>And every one of the male oppressors who are said to be women&#x2019;s enemies had a mother, usually a wife, and often sisters and daughters and cousins and aunts and nieces and friends. Those women sometimes made the lives of their men miserable, but more often they made life worth living.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.

It develops an unconventional interpretation of Confucius, one which the authors claim is truer to the traditional texts than anything ever written in English (including Wiley and Fingarette). The authors build their case from a close reading of the key Chinese terms of Confucian texts. This painstakingly detailed analysis is always readable, never too technical for a reader who knows no Chinese, but convincing by its thoroughness and its sensitivity." -- George Allan<br><br>Thinking through Confucius critically interprets the conceptual structure underlying Confucius' philosophical reflections. It also investigates "thinking," or "philosophy" from the perspective of Confucius. Perhaps the philosophical question of our time is "what is philosophy". The authors suggest that an examination of the Chinese philosophy may provide an alternative definition of philosophy that can be used to address some of the pressing issues of the Western cultural tradition. This book finds an appropriate language for the interpretation of traditional Chinese philosophical thought -- a language which is relatively free from the bias and presuppositions of Western philosophy.</p><p><p>David L.

The young women you will read about in this book represent thousands who have received the same transformation since Mercy Multiplied opened its first residential home in 1983. Many people have been diagnosed with such things as bipolar disorder, clinical depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, an eating disorder . . . the list goes on and on. These diagnoses have become their identity. They are unable to imagine a life of complete freedom without addiction, depression, or the effects of abuse. BUT there is no such thing as a life that cannot be transformed when Jesus is allowed to work. Read how these 13 heroic young women have replaced the lies that have held them in bondage with God s truth and freedom. This book will provide you with 13 REAL STORIES of why you can t argue with a changed life.</p><p>Nancy Alcorn is the Founder and President of Mercy Multiplied, a free-of-charge, biblically-based residential program for troubled young women ages thirteen to thirty-two with multiple locations in the United States and in other nations around the world. After working for the state of Tennessee in a correctional facility for girls and investigating child abuse cases, she founded Mercy Multiplied in 1983, determined to establish a program in which lives would truly be transformed. Today, Mercy not only serves young women at their residential facilities, but it also serves both men and women of all ages through its Outreach Programs. Through Outreach, Mercy offers life-changing principles of freedom through a variety of training, tools, and resources.</p><h2>Salmela Architect</h2><p>Salmela Architect provides an in-depth look at one of America&#39;s leading &#34;critical regionalist&#34; architects. Salmela&#39;s buildings resolve a central question of our time: how to balance the various extreme positions that characterize contemporary architecture and culture. Salmela accomplishes this by juxtaposing opposites: modernist and traditional forms, open and cellular plans, large and small scales, familiar elements used in unfamiliar ways. His projects range from a small stand-alone sauna to commercial spaces visited by thousands of people, and his buildings, mostly situated in the upper Midwest, have become nationally and internationally known. Salmela Architect showcases twenty-six completed buildings and sixteen current projects in lavish color photographs and architectural drawings, enabling readers to get a full sense of the practicality, ethnicity, and playfulness apparent in David Salmela&#39;s work. Architecture critic Thomas Fisher explores Salmela&#39;s propensity to draw from regional roots as he creates designs particular to individual places and cultures yet with universal appeal. Fisher illuminates this synchronicity with projects as prominent as the Gooseberry Falls Visitors Center and Wild Rice Restaurant as well as residential projects including the acclaimed Jackson Meadow community and photographer Jim Brandenburg&#39;s Ravenwood Studio.</p><p>Thomas Fisher is dean of the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at the University of Minnesota. He is the former editor of Progressive Architecture magazine and is the author of In the Scheme of Things (Minnesota, 2000).David Salmela is a self-trained architect practicing in Duluth, Minnesota. Since 1985 his projects have won fourteen Minnesota AIA Honor Awards and sixteen national level awards including a National AIA Honor Award for Architecture.</p><h2>One-Patch Quilts (Twenty to Make)</h2><p>Carolyn Forster, who is an expert quilter, provides the inspiration for making these simple quilts, using a range of lovely fabrics. A one patch quilt is essentially a patchwork quilt made from a single repeating shape. This is the simplest type of quilt you can make, but with carefully chosen coordinating patterns and colours, the results can be stunning. <br><br>The book contains 20 projects, each using a different-shaped patch; for example, there is a rectangle, a hexagon, a square, a triangle, a diamond, a clam shape, an apple core shape and so on. The quilts range from those based on a random selection of plain and patterned fabrics, to those that use just two or three different-coloured plain fabrics stitched together to form an interesting geometric design. <br><br>On each project page there is a template for the basic shape, reproduced at actual size, and some basic instructions for arranging the shapes and stitching them together, showing some different ways of making a design using colour and pattern. <br><br>Instructions at the start of the book explain how to enlarge the template if you want to make a larger quilt, and some basic quilting techniques, plus some guidance on how many shapes are needed to make a particular size of quilt. <br><br>This book is a fabulous source of ideas and inspiration for simple patchwork quilt designs that are quick and satisfying to make, while also being beautiful.</p><p>Carolyn Forster started making quilts when she was a teenager and went on to study Textiles at the University of Bath. Since graduating, she has taught patchwork and quilting both in the UK and the USA and has had her quilts featured in a number of books and magazines, including Fabrications, Popular Patchwork and Patchwork and Quilting. Carolyn lives in Tunbridge Wells, UK with her husband and son.One-Patch Quilts is Part of Search Press&#39;s bestselling 20 to Make Series which gives you bargain priced project packed books at just GBP4.99 a book. The books are smaller than most their other books, this one being 48 pages but you do still get full size templates included as well as step by step diagrams. The concept behind this book is quilt designs that only use a single block, tessellating shapes, making the cutting out and piecing quick and easy. There is a certain amount of sewing knowledge assumed with only a couple of pages of techniques at the back of the book. The focus is on making the quilt top itself, if you don&#39;t know how to baste, quilt and bind you&#39;ll need another book for those instructions. The projects themselves introduce you to the shape being used in the block, tell you how to piece it and then give a couple ideas of layouts for the finished quilt. There&#39;s a photo of one of the quilts next to the instructions so you can see how it would look. The instructions are minimal, but to be honest if you&#39;ve made a quilt before you won&#39;t need more. As the series name suggests you will find 20 different quilt designs in the book. The shapes progress from easy designs such as squares, half square triangles etc at the start of the book to more complicated designs like jewels, hexagons and apple cores (the latter 2 using English Paper Piecing) towards the end of the book. You can see the full table of contents here. I think this book is best aimed at those who have already made a quilt before but who are looking for ideas of other quilts to make. These quick and easy designs would make great scrap busters and will most likely encourage you to try sewing with shapes you haven&#39;t used before. Personally I am keen to try the braid design (pictured below) and 45 degree diamonds (at the top of the page). * The Sewing Directory *</p><h2>Emotional Detox: 7 Steps to Release Toxicity and Energize Joy</h2><p>Flush out negativity and clear a path for new positive habits, behaviors, and emotions with certified energy healer, yoga instructor, and psychology professor Sherianna Boyle&#x2019;s emotional detox program, C.L.E.A.N.S.E.<br><br>When we think of a detox, we usually think of a physical experience.

But a fatal flaw was left uncorrected: Russia's exuberant experimental moment took place atop a rotten foundation. The old imperial order, in place for three hundred years, still held the nation in thrall. Its princes, archdukes, and generals bled the country dry during the First World War and by 1917 the only consensus was that the Empire must die.<br>Mikhail Zygar's dazzling, in-the-moment retelling of the two decades that prefigured the death of the Tsar, his family, and the entire imperial edifice is a captivating drama of what might have been versus what was subsequently seen as inevitable. A monumental piece of political theater that only Russia was capable of enacting, the fall of the Russian Empire changed the course of the twentieth century and eerily anticipated the mood of the twenty-first.</p><p><b>Mikhail Zygar </b>is the former editor in chief of the only independent TV station in Russia, TV Rain (Dozhd).

The result is a riveting unfolding of history as it was being lived - and imperfectly understood - by those in the middle....If you want a book that's unlike the avalanche of other Revolutionary titles, that's well researched and better written, that transforms bit players of history into people you feel you know, that lets you experience the death shudders of an era at a century's remove, then <i>The Empire Must Die </i>must be read."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Foreign Policy</i></b></i></b><br><br>"We seem to forget how to look back in the past and learn from it; it's a pretty crucial skill for a society that wants to maintain a healthy political environment, though.

This book is worth reading...it describes the country's history through the lenses of the Russian society, not only from the point of view of statesmen and the ruler....the main goal of Zygar's book is to prove that every member of society can contribute to the development of a country's history and make difference."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>RussiaList.org</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Zygar has written a riveting account....A vivid sense of real-time chaos, confusion, and the multitude of ideas for bringing Russia into the 20th century is well documented in a readable journalistic manner....

Namaste then examines some of the rhetorical and semiotic inscriptions of transgendered figures in culture, including studies of early punk and glam rock subcultures, to illustrate how the effacement of transgendered people is organized in different cultural sites. <i>Invisible Lives</i> concludes with new research on some of the day-to-day concerns of transgendered people, offering case studies in violence, health care, gender identity clinics, and the law.</p></p><p><b>Viviane K.

In this book Deborah Fitzgerald argues that farms became modernized in the 1920s because they adopted not only new machinery but also the financial, cultural, and ideological apparatus of industrialism. Fitzgerald examines how bankers and emerging professionals in engineering and economics pushed for systematic, businesslike farming. She discusses how factory practices served as a template for the creation across the country of industrial or corporate farms. She looks at how farming was affected by this revolution and concludes by following several agricultural enthusiasts to the Soviet Union, where the lessons of industrial farming were studied.</p><p>Yale Series in Agrarian StudiesDeborah Fitzgerald is associate professor in the Programme in Science, Technology and Society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><h2>The Language of Music (Clarendon Paperbacks)</h2><p>First published in 1959, this original study argues that the main characteristic of music is that it expresses and evokes emotion, and that all composers whose music has a tonal basis have used the same, or closely similar, melodic phrases, harmonies, and rhythms to affect the listener in the same ways. He supports this view with hundreds of musical examples, ranging from plainsong to Stravinsky, and contends that music is a language in the specific sense that we can identify idioms and draw up a list of meanings. The book's final section analyzes two symphonies, Mozart's Fortieth and Vaughan Williams's Sixth, to explore the nature of musical inspiration and the process whereby the notes actually convey emotion from composer to listener.<br></p><p>This important book has come to be regarded as a modern classic. Originally published in 1959, it has exerted a profound influence on all subsequent discussion in the field of musical aesthetics. Deryck Cooke&#39;s thesis is that the fundamental characteristic of music is the expression and evocation of emotion. He argues that all composers whose music has a tonal basis have used the same, or closely similar, melodic phrases, harmonies, and rhythms to express and evoke the same emotions. He supports this view with numerous musical examples, ranging from plainsong to Stravinsky, and he argues that music is a language in the quite specific sense that idiom can be identified and a list of meanings compiled. While acknowledging that a &#39;dictionary&#39; of the language of music cannot easily be provided, he here attempts to supply at least a &#39;phrase-book&#39;.<br>"One of the most important publications of post-war English musicography...its honesty, its individualism, and its empiricism reflect the best intellectual traditions of English literature."--<em>Music and Letters</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Quantum Theory of Fields, Volume 3: Supersymmetry</h2><p>Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg continues his masterly exposition of quantum field theory.

Simon Critchley argues that poetry enlarges life with a range of observation, power of expression and attention to language that eclipses any other medium. In a rich engagement with the poetry of Wallace Stevens, Critchley reveals that poetry also contains deep and important philosophical insight. Above all, he agues for a 'poetic epistemology' that enables us to think afresh the philosophical problem of the relation between mind and world, and ultimately to cast the problem away.<br><br>Drawing astutely on Kant, the German and English Romantics and Heidegger, Critchley argues that through its descriptions of particular things and their stubborn plainness - whether water, guitars, trees, or cats - poetry evokes the 'mereness' of things. It is this experience, he shows, that provokes the mood of calm and releases the imaginative insight we need to press back against the pressure of reality. Critchley also argues that this calm defines the cinematic eye of Terrence Malick, whose work is discussed at the end of the book.</p><p>Simon Critchley is Professor of Philosophy at the New School for Social Research, New York and at the University of Essex. He is the author of many books, including <em>Very Little ...

Clerge compellingly analyzes the making of a new multinational Black middle class and how they create a spectrum of Black identities that help them carve out places of their own in a changing 21st-century global city.<br><br> Paying particular attention to the largest Black ethnic groups in the country, Black Americans, Jamaicans, and Haitians, Clerge&#x2019;s ethnography draws on over 80 interviews with residents to examine the overlooked places where New York&#x2019;s middle class resides in Queens and Long Island. This book reveals that region and nationality shape how the Black middle class negotiates the everyday politics of race and class.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><p>"In<i>&nbsp;The New Noir</i>, Orly Clerge skillfully documents the changing meaning of Blackness for today&amp;;s diasporic Black middle class.

Beginning with a strong theoretical foundation grounded in political, communications and psychology literature, <em>Tweeting to Power</em> examines the effect of online social media on how people come to learn, understand and engage in politics. Gainous and Wagner propose that platforms such as Facebook and Twitter offer the opportunity for a new information flow that is no longer being structured and limited by the popular media. Television and newspapers, which were traditionally the sole or primary gatekeeper, can no longer limit or govern what information is exchanged. By lowering the cost of both supplying the information and obtaining it, social networking applications have recreated how, when and where people are informed. <br><br>To establish this premise, Gainous and Wagner analyze multiple datasets, quantitative and qualitative, exploring and measuring the use of social media by voters and citizens as well as the strategies and approaches adopted by politicians and elected officials. They illustrate how these new and growing online communities are new forums for the exchange of information that is governed by relationships formed and maintained outside traditional media. Using empirical measures, they prove both how candidates utilize Twitter to shape the information voters rely upon and how effective this effort was at garnering votes in the 2010 congressional elections. With both theory and data, Gainous and Wagner show how the social media revolution is creating a new paradigm for political communication and shifting the very foundation of the political process.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jason Gainous</strong> is Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Louisville. <strong>Kevin M. Wagner </strong>is Assistant Professor of Political Science at Florida Atlantic University.<br><br>"Even as social media continue to evolve, <em>Tweeting to Power</em> captures a current snapshot of campaign politics that demonstrates how the strategic use of social media can be a powerful advantage in winning elections." --Anthony Rotolo, Syracuse University, <em>Political Science Quarterly</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Tweeting to Power</em> is the most ambitious and well-researched study of social media's political consequences to date. Using an impressive array of qualitative and quantitative data, Gainous and Wagner systematically track how Twitter and Facebook are influencing Congress, political parties and the American public. This book is much more than a narrow study of social media, however. By situating their evidence in long-standing theoretical debates, Gainous and Wagner tackle more fundamental questions about the functioning of American democracy in the age of the internet. Tweeting to Power is essential reading for anyone interested in technology's impact on election campaigns, political communication and public opinion."--Kevin Wallsten, California State University, Long Beach <br><p></p><br>"Social media have already become a fundamental part of politics in the digital age. In Tweeting to Power, Jason Gainous and Kevin M. Wagner use an impressive array of quantitative and qualitative data to explore a wide variety of questions about the impacts of social media on American politics.

Said to be the disembodied spirit of an unruly harlot, Pomba Gira is a controversial figure in Brazil. Devotees maintain that Pomba Gira possesses an intimate knowledge of human affairs and the mystical power to intervene in the human world. Others view this entity more ambivalently. Kelly E. Hayes provides an intimate and engaging account of the intricate relationship between Pomba Gira and one of her devotees, Nazar� da Silva. Combining Nazar�&#x2019;s spiritual biography with analysis of the gender politics and violence that shapes life on the periphery of Rio de Janeiro, Hayes highlights Pomba Gira&#x2019;s role in the rivalries, relationships, and struggles of everyday life in urban Brazil.<br><br>A DVD of the film <i>Slaves of the Saints</i> is included.</p><p>"An enthralling account of the spirits of the street, whose stories are as complex as those of their human hosts.

This magisterial study re-examines Charlemagne the ruler and his reputation. It analyses the narrative representations of Charlemagne produced after his death, and thereafter focuses on the evidence from Charlemagne&#39;s lifetime concerning the creation of the Carolingian dynasty and the growth of the kingdom, the court and the royal household, communications and identities in the Frankish realm in the context of government, and Charlemagne&#39;s religious and cultural strategies. The book offers a critical examination of the contemporary sources and in so doing transforms our understanding of the development of the Carolingian empire, the formation of Carolingian political identity, and the astonishing changes effected throughout Charlemagne&#39;s forty-six year period of rule. This is a major contribution to Carolingian history which will be essential reading for anyone interested in the medieval past. Rosamond McKitterick has also received the 2010 Dr A. H.

How is listening different from hearing? What does listening entail? How does what is heard differ from what is seen? Can philosophy even address listening, �couter, as opposed to entendre, which means both hearing and understanding?<br><br>Unlike the visual arts, sound produces effects that persist long after it has stopped. The body, Nancy says, is itself like an echo chamber, responding to music by inner vibrations as well as outer attentiveness. Since &#x201c;the ear has no eyelid&#x201d; (Quignard), sound cannot be blocked out or ignored: our whole being is involved in listening, just as it is involved in interpreting what it hears.<br><br>The mystery of music and of its effects on the listener is subtly examined. Nancy&#x2019;s skill as a philosopher is to bring the reader companionably along with him as he examines these fresh and vital questions; by the end of the book the reader feels as if listening very carefully to a person talking quietly, close to the ear.</p></p><p><b>Jean-Luc Nancy</b> is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the Universit� Marc Bloch, Strasbourg.

The main body of the work consists of an alphabetical glossary of all words and phrases used in a sexual or scatological sense, with full explanations and cross-references.</p><p>When Shakespeare's plays were first performed, they were popular with everyone: they weren't classics yet or a requisite course to be suffered. The stories were good entertainment for the masses, with a bawdy streak a mile wide. Certainly Shakespeare's depth and insight into human nature was appreciated, but surely some came just for the dirt. Shakespeare's contemporaries didn't need a glossary to get the jokes, but we do. Thank goodness for Eric Partridge's dictionary of Elizabethan smut, so we can get the double-entendres, too. Thus, "hardening of one's brows" (<i>The Winter's Tale</i>) refers to being cuckolded, "laced mutton" (<i>Two Gentleman of Verona</i>) is a prostitute, "riggish" (<i>Cleopatra</i>) means lascivious, and "groping for trout in a peculiar river" (<i>Measure for Measure</i>) means copulating with a woman. With an essay on the sexual, homosexual, and nonsexual bawdy in Shakespeare, an index to the essay, and a full glossary of bawdry, Partridge puts the nudge and wink back in Shakespeare.<strong>Eric Partridge</strong> (1884-1979) was the author of some three dozen books, mainly on the aspects of the English language. <strong>Stanley Wells</strong> is an eminent Shakespearean scholar and the general editor of <em>Oxford Shakespeare.</em></p><h2>Facilitating Emotional Change: The Moment-by-Moment Process</h2><p>While emotions are often given a negative connotation people are described as being "too emotional" or as needing to "control their emotions" this book demonstrates that emotions are organizing processes that enhance adaptation and problem solving. Within an experiential therapy framework, the volume shows how to work with moment-by-moment emotional processes to resolve various psychological difficulties. The first two sections introduce the process experiential approach to treatment. Exploring the interrelationships among emotion, cognition, and change, the authors develop a powerful, clinically relevant theory of human functioning. The third section, a detailed treatment manual, outlines the general principles and methods of therapy and provides step-by-step directions for six specific types of interventions. Excerpts from actual transcripts exemplify the various methods, illuminating the moment-by-moment process for both the client and the therapist. <br></p><p>Leslie S.

Drawing on a course the editors teach at Harvard Law School, the book traces the rise and evolution of a distinctly American form of legal reasoning. These are the articles that have made these authors--from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., to Ronald Coase, from Ronald Dworkin to Catherine MacKinnon--among the most recognized names in American legal history.</p><br><p> These authors proposed answers to the classic question: "What does it mean to think like a lawyer--an American lawyer?" Their answers differed, but taken together they form a powerful brief for the existence of a distinct and powerful style of reasoning--and of rulership. The legal mind is as often critical as constructive, however, and these texts form a canon of critical thinking, a toolbox for resisting and unravelling the arguments of the best legal minds. Each article is preceded by a short introduction highlighting the article's main ideas and situating it in the context of its author's broader intellectual projects, the scholarly debates of his or her time, and the reception the article received.</p><br><p> Law students and their teachers will benefit from seeing these classic writings, in full, in the context of their original development. For lawyers, the collection will take them back to their best days in law school. All readers will be struck by the richness, the subtlety, and the sophistication with which so many of what have become the clich�s of everyday legal argument were originally formulated.</p></p><p><p>"Legal thought is a much broader category, and one of more general interest to law students, than jurisprudence, but until now there has been no collection available to readers.

Responsible for coining the term to describe places of community-based cultural importance, Thomas King now revisits this subject to instruct readers in TCP site identification, documentation, and management. With more than 30 years of experience at working with communities on such sites, he identifies common issues of contention and methods of resolving them through consultation and other means. Through the extensive use of examples, from urban ghettos to Polynesian ponds to Mount Shasta, TCPs are shown not to be limited simply to American Indian burial and religious sites, but include a wide array of valued locations and landscapes&#x2015;the United States and worldwide. This is a must-read for anyone involved in historical preservation, cultural resource management, or community development.</p><p>Thomas F. King has worked in historic preservation since the mid-1960&#39;s as an academic, a contractor, and a government official.

He is the author of Cultural Resource Laws and Practice: An Introductory Guide (AltaMira Press, 1998) and Federal Planning and Historic Places: The Section 106 Practice (AltaMira Press,2000) and many other book, articles, and monographs.As a cultural resource manager who has worked and struggled with Traditional Cultural Properties for years, Tom King's new book puts many of my past experiences into perspective and provided new ideas and insights for future practice.

This volume is an elegant and eloquent presentation of preservation laws and regulations, coupled with King's philosophical ruminations about how they might have been, and might yet be, better used in the interests of everyone concerned with historic preservation of places and the multiplicity of meanings attached thereto. King knows preservation laws and regulations perhaps better than any one in the country, and is keenly aware that, in the end, both are matters of (often contested) interpretation. We would do well, in the interests of heritage preservation in general and traditional cultural places in particular, to listen to and act upon&#x2015;what he has to tell us.

To most, he remains Great Britain's greatest Prime Minister, his fame and charisma overshadowing those who followed in his footsteps. Yet while he presided over his country's finest hour, he was not its most consequential leader. In this definitive new biography, John Bew reveals how that designation belongs to Clement Attlee, Churchill's successor, who launched a new era of political, economic, and social reform that would forever change Great Britain.<br><br>Bew's thorough and keen examination of Attlee, the former leader of the Labour Party, illuminates how his progressive beliefs shaped his influential domestic and international policy. Alternatively criticized for being "too socialist" or "not radical enough," Attlee's quiet tenacity was intrinsic to the success of his party and highly pertinent to British identity overall. In 1948, he established the National Health Service as part of his "British New Deal"-a comprehensive, universal system of insurance, welfare, and family allowances to be enjoyed by all British citizens. Attlee also initiated key advancements in international relations by supporting the development of both the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and by granting independence to India, Burma, and Ceylon. More controversially, he sanctioned the building of Britain's nuclear deterrent in response to the rise of the Soviet Union and the threat of atomic bombs. <br><br><em>Clement Attlee: The Man Who Made Modern Britain</em> explores his tenure in the years after the war, as he presided over a radical new government in an age of austerity and imperial decline. Bew mines contemporary memoirs, diaries, and press excerpts to present readers with an illuminating and intimate look into Attlee's life and career. Attentive to both the man and the political landscape, this comprehensive biography provides new insight into the soul of a leader who transformed his country and by extension the vast empire over which it once ruled.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Bew </strong>is Professor of History and Foreign Policy at the War Studies Department at King's College London.

In this respect, I was, however, pleasantly surprised ... This is a compassionate biography that seeks to celebrate Attlee as a decent and humble man whose heart was in the right place and who was impressively adept at holding his party together after the electoral catastrophe of 1931 and in delivering on the promises of the 1945 election manifesto." -- Laura Beers, <em>Journal of Modern</em> <em>History</em><p></p><br>"[A] superb biography..."--Ferdinand Mount, <em>New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"Easily the best single-volume, cradle-to-grave life of Clement Attlee yet written.

In his landmark book <i>Biophilia</i>, he examined how our tendency to focus on life and lifelike processes might be a biologically based need, integral to our development as individuals and as a species. That idea has caught the imagination of diverse thinkers.<i>The Biophilia Hypothesis</i> brings together the views of some of the most creative scientists of our time, each attempting to amplify and refine the concept of biophilia. The variety of perspectives -- psychological, biological, cultural, symbolic, and aesthetic -- frame the theoretical issues by presenting empirical evidence that supports or refutes the hypothesis. Numerous examples illustrate the idea that biophilia and its converse, biophobia, have a genetic component: fear, and even full-blown phobias of snakes and spiders are quick to develop with very little negative reinforcement, while more threatening modern artifacts -- knives, guns, automobiles -- rarely elicit such a response people find trees that are climbable and have a broad, umbrella-like canopy more attractive than trees without these characteristics people would rather look at water, green vegetation, or flowers than built structures of glass and concrete The biophilia hypothesis, if substantiated, provides a powerful argument for the conservation of biological diversity. More important, it implies serious consequences for our well-being as society becomes further estranged from the natural world. Relentless environmental destruction could have a significant impact on our quality of life, not just materially but psychologically and even spiritually.</p><p>Why is it that most of us find baby animals irresistibly cute? Why do so many people fear even the sight of snakes? What prompts us to feed birds, to allow cats to roam around the house at will, to admire the lines of dogs and horses? Stephen Kellert and Edward Wilson, the prolific Harvard biologist, gather essays by various hands on these and other questions, and the result is a fascinating glimpse into our relations with other animals. Humans, Wilson writes, have an innate (or at least extremely ancient) connection to the natural world, and our continued divorce from it has led to the loss of not only &#34;a vast intellectual legacy born of intimacy&#34; with nature but also our very sanity. There is much to ponder in this timely book.Stephen R. Kellert was the Tweedy/Ordway Professor of Social Ecology at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and author of numerous books including, <i>The Biophilia Hypothesis</i> (coedited with E. O. Wilson, 1993), <i>The Value of Life: Biological Diversity and Human Society</i> (1996), <i>Kinship to Mastery: Biophilia in Human Evolution and Development</i> (1997), T<i>he Good in Nature and Humanity: Connecting Science, Religion, and Spirituality with the Natural World</i> (coedited with T.

Based in New Julfa, Isfahan, in what is now Iran, these merchants operated a network of commercial settlements that stretched from London and Amsterdam to Manila and Acapulco. The New Julfan Armenians were the only Eurasian community that was able to operate simultaneously and successfully in all the major empires of the early modern world&#x2015;both land-based Asian empires and the emerging sea-borne empires&#x2015;astonishingly without the benefits of an imperial network and state that accompanied and facilitated European mercantile expansion during the same period. This book brings to light for the first time the trans-imperial cosmopolitan world of the New Julfans. Among other topics, it explores the effects of long distance trade on the organization of community life, the ethos of trust and cooperation that existed among merchants, and the importance of information networks and communication in the operation of early modern mercantile communities.</p><p>"Sebouh David Aslanian draws upon an unrivaled body of original documentation, collected in seven languages from twenty-five archives, to reconstruct in great detail the logic and working of a global commercial network.

In this book, two long-time certified Project Management Professionals (PMPRs) and Scrum trainers have built a bridge to this dynamic new paradigm. They show experienced project managers how to successfully transition to agile by refocusing on facilitation and collaboration, not &#x201c;command and control.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The authors begin by explaining how agile works: how it differs from traditional &#x201c;plan-driven&#x201d; methodologies, the benefits it promises, and the real-world results it delivers.

Agilists), but we didn't start out that way. We began as Project Management Professionals (PMP�) 1 who used more traditional methods in the development of software.</p> <p><b>Why We Wrote This Book</b></p> <p>We followed the approaches outlined in the Project Management Institute's <i>A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge&#x2014;Third Edition </i>(<i>PMBOK� Guide</i>) for much of our careers, and in moving to Agile approaches we became more aware of the misconceptions out there surrounding the subject matter of this book&#x2014;incorrect ideas that we once believed as well. Now as Agile consultants, we continue to hear our clients say that they believe (incorrectly) that if they are to keep their PMP certification and follow the practices outlined in the <i>PMBOK� Guide</i> that they must use a waterfall-like methodology. We also hear the mistaken belief that Agile approaches lack discipline and rigor. And we see the fear and dismay of those who believe that their investment in the Project Management Institute (PMI) may be for naught if they follow the path to agility.</p> <p>It is our goal to dispel these myths in our book and show that the Third Edition of the <i>PMBOK� Guide</i> does in fact support Agile software development methods and that the investment that project managers have made in the PMI and in the practices outlined in the <i>PMBOK� Guide</i> are still solid and appropriate to pursue. It is clear to us that the <i>PMBOK� Guide</i> is methodology-neutral and supports good project management practices regardless of the approach chosen. Although many are already aware of this fact, we find that there are still many who are not. As PMPs who are now Agile enthusiasts, we feel it is important to also dispel the mistaken notion in the Agile community that PMPs cannot be good Agile project managers. We would like to build a bridge between the two, thus the need for this book.</p> <p><b>Structure and Content of the Book</b></p> <p>Accordingly, we've put much of the detail concerning this bridging in Part II, where we map the <i>PMBOK� Guide's</i> practices to Agile practices. It is our intent to show project managers that in moving to an Agile methodology, they do not move away from implementing PMI-recommended practices&#x2014;they simply implement the practices in a different way, making sure that the intent behind these practices remains true. In some chapters you'll find a clear mapping, whereas in others the mapping is more imprecise. This book is intended to be a guide, a way to take the lexicon you are already familiar with and relate it to a new way of developing software. This book will not replace any of the more specific Agile practice books in the market today, and we encourage you to supplement this reading with other books on particular Agile methods (Scrum, XP, Lean, Crystal, and so on).</p> <p>The next several sections provide a quick preview of the book.</p> <p><b>Part I: An Agile Overview</b></p> <p>Part I introduces you to the basic terms and concepts of Agile software development. We begin in the first chapter ("What is Agile?") with a look back at the emergence of agile ideas in the history of software development. You may be surprised to learn that even Winston Royce's paper on the waterfall approach recommended an iterative cycle and the involvement of the end user in the whole of the project! From this history we move forward and review the concepts behind the Agile Manifesto and its associated principles, which are the basis of all agile software development frameworks.</p> <p>In Chapter 2, "Mapping from the <i>PMBOK� Guide</i> to Agile," we look at the history of the PMI and its most famous contribution to the practice of project management, the <i>PMBOK� Guide. </i>We'll examine how the <i>PMBOK� Guide</i> project lifecycle phases and project management process groups can be related to the Agile Fractal. And we'll reiterate again that you can be agile and be in keeping with the recommendations outlined in the <i>PMBOK� Guide.</i> </p> <p>Chapter 3, "The Agile Project Lifecycle," describes the agile project lifecycle&#x2014;from release planning to iteration planning to daily planning&#x2014;and how demos, reviews, and retrospectives at the end of each iteration allow the team to continually improve. This chapter begins the use of terminology and concepts that we expand on throughout the rest of the book.</p> <p><b>Part II: The Bridge: Relating <i>PMBOK� Guide</i> Practices to Agile Practices</b></p> <p>This is the part of the book where we review each of the <i>PMBOK� Guide</i> knowledge areas and discuss what you used to do as a traditional project manager, and what you should consider doing instead as an agile project manager. As the title implies, we are trying to build an explicit bridge between the traditional and the agile, and provide you with guidance on what tasks and activities you should substitute&#x2014;or keep.</p> <p>As it is in the <i>PMBOK� Guide,</i> the knowledge areas are not in any type of chronological order. In both traditional and agile project management settings, you will find yourself doing most of these activities in parallel.</p> <p>Because there is some overlap in the knowledge areas, you may find some ideas and concepts repeated. We did this intentionally, because we expect many of you to use this part of the book as a reference guide, and may therefore start with any of these chapters in any order. However, to keep the repetition to a minimum, we do use references to other chapters rather than rewrite large sections.</p> <p>The chapters in Part II include the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Chapter 4: "Integration Management"</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 5: "Scope Management"</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 6: "Time Management"</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 7: "Cost Management"</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 8: "Quality Management"</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 9: "Human Resources Management"</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 10: "Communications Management"</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 11: "Risk Management"</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 12: "Procurement Management"</p> </li> </ul> <p><b>Part III: Crossing the Bridge to Agile</b></p> <p>Whereas Part II covers the specific practical activity changes, Part III covers the softer skills of being an agent of change and what this change means for you personally and professionally. Having answered much of the "what" you need to do in Part II, we turn our focus to "how" to make these changes in Part III. From how your role changes, to how you'll work with others who aren't agile, to what to watch out for, we respond to the commonly asked questions of those who are about to cross the bridge. The chapters in Part III complete the main body of the book:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Chapter 13: "How Will My Role as a Project Manager Change?"</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 14: "How Will I Work with Other Teams Who Aren't Agile?"</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 15: "How Can a Project Management Office Support Agile? "</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 16: "Selling the Benefits of Agile"</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 17: "Common Mistakes"</p> </li> </ul> <p><b>Appendixes</b></p> <p>We've included two appendixes we hope you will find useful. Appendix A, "Agile Methodologies," runs down a number of the software development methodologies that fall under the Agile umbrella. Appendix B, "Typical Agile Artifacts," includes a look at the typical Agile project "artifacts."</p> <p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p> <p>Although this book is targeted at software project managers who are members of the PMI, anyone who is doing traditional software project management will benefit from seeing agility presented in terminology to which they are accustomed. We will refer to these long-established methodologies as "waterfall," "plan-driven," or "traditional," all of which refer to sequential, phased, noniterative approaches to software development.</p> <p><b>Final Thoughts</b></p> <p>We should also make it clear that we are not sanctioned by PMI or any of its representatives. This book is the result of our research, interpretation, and experience. Although we used the Third Edition of the <i>PMBOK� Guide</i> in our studies, we expect that as the <i>PMBOK� Guide</i> goes through further revisions, you will still find the concepts presented here to be relevant.</p> <p><b>Endnotes</b></p> <p> 1.

The essays make original contributions to ethics and display Schopenhauer&#39;s erudition, prose-style and flair for philosophical controversy, as well as philosophical views that contrast sharply with the positions of both Kant and Nietzsche. Written accessibly, they do not presuppose the intricate metaphysics which Schopenhauer constructs elsewhere. This is the first English translation of these works to re-unite both essays in one volume. It offers a new translation by Christopher Janaway, together with an introduction, editorial notes on Schopenhauer&#39;s vocabulary and the different editions of his essays, a chronology of his life, a bibliography, and a glossary of names.</p><p>This is the first English edition of Arthur Schopenhauer&#39;s The Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics (1841) to re-unite both essays in one volume.

This book is a detailed examination of these principles, using data from a wide array of vertebrates but minimizing technical details and terminology. It is written for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and more senior scientists who already know something about "the brain," but want a deeper understanding of how diverse brains evolved.<br><br>The book opens with a brief history of evolutionary neuroscience, then introduces the various groups of vertebrates and their major brain regions. The core of the text explores: what aspects of brain organization are conserved across the vertebrates; how brains and bodies changed in size as vertebrates evolved; how individual brain regions tend to increase or decrease in size; how regions can become structurally more (or less) complex; and how neuronal circuitry evolves. A central theme emerges from these chapters--that evolutionary changes in brain size tend to correlate with many other aspects of brain structure and function, including the proportional size of individual brain regions, their complexity, and their neuronal connections. To explain these correlations, the book delves into rules of brain development and asks how changes in brain structure impact function and behavior. The two penultimate chapters demonstrate the application of these rules, focusing on how mammal brains diverged from other brains and how <em>Homo sapiens</em> evolved a very large and "special" brain.<br></p><p><br><strong>Georg Striedter</strong> is Associate Professor in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at the University of California, Irvine. He received his undergraduate training at Cornell University and obtained a Ph.D. from the University of California, San Diego in 1990. Most of his early research focused on the evolution of various functionally interesting pathways in fish brains. He then went on to study avian brains as a postdoctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology. Specifically, he studied how and why parrot brains are specialized for imitating sounds. Dr. Striedter continued this work as a faculty member at UC Irvine and broadened it to include questions about how avian brains differ from those of other vertebrates in terms of structure, function and development. In 1998, he received the C. J. Herrick Award for his contributions to comparative neuroanatomy.<br><br>"This text will surely supersede its stated goal, to pique the interest in brain evolution of advanced undergraduate and graduate students. From the very beginning, with the fascinating example of Bumpus' sparrows of 1898, we know this book will be more witty and lively than most on this topic. Throughout the remaining text, Striedter succeeds repeatedly by explicating the main principles of brain evolution without encyclopedic or dry detail. As a result of this new text, we can certainly anticipate that young students of evolutionary neuroscience will be enticed to address questions that currently lack much empirical data." <br>--David C. Airey,<em> Genes, Brain and Behavior</em><p></p><br>"This volume offers an enduring and succinct summary of the vast archive of morphological data that reveals the wondrous diversity of brains." <br>--Robert W. Doty, <em>The Quarterly Review of Biology</em><p></p><br>"Georg Striedter has produced a wonderful book that discusses current understandings of brain evolution. Overall, this is a volume that most neuroscientists will enjoy reading, and some of them, myself included, will find it useful as a textbook for graduate students and advanced undergraduates." <br>--Jon H. Kaas, <em>Nature Neuroscience</em><p></p><br>"In <em>Principles of Brain Evolution</em>, Striedter accomplishes several important goals: he conveys the many aspects of brain structure and function that are conserved across species; he illustrates in a clear manner why species differences are real and should not be dismissed; he explores the complex issue as to how conservation and divergence--noted at various levels of neural organization--relate to one another; and finally, he hypothesizes as to how the rules of brain development have consequences for how the brains evolve. Astonishingly, Striedter accomplishes these goals in some 360 pages of text! I highly recommend this book." <br>--C. A.

This new work is a major contribution to recent debates on the rule of law and the possibilities of democracy in postindustrial societies, but it is much more. The introduction by William Rehg succinctly captures the special nature of the work, noting that it offers a sweeping, sociologically informed conceptualization of law and basic rights, a normative account of the rule of law and the constitutional state, an attempt to bridge normative and empirical approaches to democracy, and an account of the social context required for democracy. Finally, the work frames and caps these arguments with a bold proposal for a new paradigm of law that goes beyond the dichotomies that have afflicted modern political theory from its inception and that still underlie current controversies between so-called liberals and civic republicans. The book includes a postscript written in 1994, which restates the argument in light of its initial reception, and two appendixes, which cover key developments that preceded the book. Habermas himself was actively involved in the translation, adapting the text as necessary to make it more accessible to English-speaking readers.</p></p><p>Jurgen Habermas, an esteemed political philosopher who lived in Germany during the Nazi reign, has produced a thought-provoking work on what he calls &#34;deliberative politics.&#34; To summarize his view, true democracy isn&#39;t just the compilation of opinions or a blanket treatment of majority rules, but a social process in which people meet, discuss, modify and, ultimately, agree. He draws connections between how such a process could shape the making of laws and direct the course of nations. His writings here represent a lifetime of political thought on the nature of democracy and law, and deserve an audience and a place in the foundations of democratic theory.This book works out the legal and political implications of his &#39;Theory of Communicative Action&#39; (1981), bringing to fruition the project announced with his publication of &#39;The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere&#39; in 1962. This new work is a major contribution to recent debates on the rule of law and the possibilities of democracy in postindustrial societies, but it is much more.</p><h2>A History of the Peoples of Siberia: Russia's North Asian Colony 1581&#x2013;1990</h2><p>This is the first ethnohistory of Siberia to appear in English, and presents to an anglophone audience a vast corpus of previously inaccessible ethnographic and linguistic material.

It includes a strong historical perspective on these deficits as well as descriptions of current neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. It covers many aspects of intervention such as quality of life issues that many books do not address. The book's main strength is that it is comprehensive. The only possible criticism is that this comprehensiveness could be seen as rather daunting by students. But it is a book many would want to subsequently keep for their professional libraries.

That means she is responsible for what you see on the computer screen&#x2014;website navigation, applications, forms, categories, and words. She works mostly on large, messy projects like government websites and intranets, internal business applications, and web applications. But sometimes she gets to work on funky, small projects and likes them just as much. Some of her projects take months to do, and sometimes she works with agile programming teams to do small amounts of work in short bursts. One of the most important parts of her work is to get a good understanding of the needs of the users and make sure the system she's working on is as usable as possible. Given that she's quite fond of people, she loves doing user research and running usability tests to understand the people she's designing for. She also sketches screens, draws wireframes, and makes prototypes. But Donna likes something even more than designing usable systems. She loves teaching.

Many are material, related to environmental and climatic alteration, to the domestication of livestock and development of agriculture, to technology, to disease, and to variations in human immunity, reproduction, and physiology. <br> <p> Others are social and cultural, touching upon issues of migration, trade, language development and differentiation, institutions of enslavement and of freedom, traditions of marriage and child-rearing, the emergence of large-scale political organization from early kingdoms to vast empires, republics and federations, and the management of war and peace.</p> <p> To deal with such challenging issues, global historians draw upon new techniques of analysis and comparison. But they also continue venerable traditions, inherited from the earliest civilizations, of narrating the past on the most comprehensive and significant scale possible.</p> <p> This book examines the long search for an integrated human story, and particularly the points at which rapid changes of philosophy and perspective in the twentieth century transformed the historical disciplines.

In the contentious <i>Planters, Merchants, and Slaves</i>, Burnard argues that white men did not choose to develop and maintain the plantation system out of virulent racism or sadism, but rather out of economic logic because&#x2014;to speak bluntly&#x2014;it worked. These economically successful and ethically monstrous plantations required racial divisions to exist, but their successes were measured in gold, rather than skin or blood. Sure to be controversial, this book is a major intervention in the scholarship on slavery, economic development, and political power in early British America, mounting a powerful and original argument that boldly challenges historical orthodoxy.</p><p><b>Trevor Burnard</b> is professor in and head of the School of Historical and Philosophical Studies at the University of Melbourne. He is the author of <i>Mastery, Tyranny, and Desire</i> and <i>Creole Gentlemen</i>, as well as coeditor of <i>The Routledge History of Slavery</i>.&#x201c;Burnard gives us a commanding work of scholarly synthesis and layers it with original research to offer a provocative meditation on the meaning of plantation societies in the early modern Atlantic world.&nbsp;<i>Planters, Merchants, and Slaves</i>&nbsp;draws the Chesapeake, Carolina Lowcountry, and British Caribbean into a single interpretive frame and, by doing so, highlights British Plantation America&#x2019;s enormous dynamism and significance.&#x201d; (<i>S. Max Edelson, author of Plantation Enterprise in Colonial South Carolina</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In this social, economic, and demographic history, Burnard brilliantly anatomizes the British plantation system and plantation slavery.&nbsp;His conspectus ranges over nearly two centuries, from Guyana to the Chesapeake.&nbsp;It bristles with insight and even finds new meaning in the American Revolution.&nbsp;Novice students and grizzled scholars alike will find much to appreciate in Burnard&#x2019;s pages.&#x201d; (<i>J.R. McNeill, author of Mosquito Empires: Ecology and War in the Greater Caribbean, 1620&#x2013;1914</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Peppered with provocative arguments&#x2014;regarding the military, what today we would call race hatred, and the American Revolution&#x2019;s legacy of enslavement&#x2014;Burnard&#x2019;s work makes its main contribution in the detail with which he limns out the history of the plantation sector. . . . In following the arc of this history, Burnard&#x2019;s greatest contribution may be in his careful comparative work across regions that scholars often treat as distinct. . . . Not all readers will agree with each of his interpretations but he offers us a compelling frame�work for thinking about slavery and its place within the British Empire and the new United States. It is a tribute to his accomplishment that we come away wishing that the book went beyond the various regions within plantation British America to illuminate in addition the plantation societies founded by others.&#x201d; (Carla Gardina Pestana <i>Journal of Early American History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Burnard&#x2019;s wide reading, along with his willingness to chal�lenge long-held assumptions, means that his book hews a fresh path across several overlapping fields. He may well prompt disagreements, but those who read him are all likely to benefit from the freshness of his observations and the range of his examples. Readers will come away from this book with plenty of new insights.&#x201d; (James Robertson <i>Journal of Early American History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Burnard&#x2019;s synthesis recognizes the distinctive regions of plantation America&#x2014;the Chesapeake tobacco economy, the Carolina Low Country rice economy, and the Caribbean sugar economy&#x2014;while also recognizing systemic structural regularities. These included powerful local elites, destructive and violent slave regimes, and wealth that benefited local elites and metropoles but not an entire colony. Burnard especially treats Jamaica, Virginia, and the effects of the American Revolution. He demonstrates that the plantation system was, from an imperial perspective, an economic success, even though its wealth was only a tiny proportion of the metropolitan economy. The author does not intend this demonstration of economic rationality to mitigate the social, demographic, and environmental devastations of the system that have been so well documented. Recommended.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Given Burnard&#x2019;s extensive experience writing about and researching slavery in various sites across this vast region&#x2014;Maryland, Jamaica, and Demerara, most notably&#x2014;it is hard to imagine a guide better positioned to lead an excursion through this vast historiography. And indeed, the book ably draws examples and insights from the whole region, with attention to both commonalities and contrasts. No simple Caribbean-versus-North America binary emerges. Instead, plantation colonies shared broad profitability rooted in their common reliance on violence. Nonetheless, various colonies and regions remained distinct from each other due to variations of crop, size, time of development, geography, internal politics, and degree of economic diversity. It is a tremendous challenge for a work of synthesis to avoid flattening out the picture of the places it covers, and Burnard succeeds in summarizing while keeping local variation in focus.&#x201d; (<i>William and Mary Quarterly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a book that exhilarates. It is also one that will vex many readers. The exhilaration stems from Trevor Burnard&#x2019;s geographical reach and conceptual ambition. This is a bold, bravura performance that ranges from the Chesapeake to Demerara. . . . A short review cannot do justice to all the themes of this arresting and provocative work. Readers will find much to applaud and much to take issue with. No one will feel their time has been wasted,&#x201d; (Chris Evans <i>Journal of Southern History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Burnard&#x2019;s new book is a response to Russell R. Menard&#x2019;s challenge to scholars to historicize three things: the development of large-scale British colonial sugar, rice, and tobacco plantations; the gang labor system of slavery they generally employed; and the dominance of the planter class in the colonies with such systems. That is, rather than assume an almost natural evolution of small farms into ever-larger colonial staple plantations, historians need to investigate when, how, and why large plantations were brought into existence. Burnard, like Menard, brings to this exploration of the causes and consequences of the plantation system a broad background of research in the archival sources of both the colonial Caribbean and southern mainland colonies. The result is a provocative book that is about both more and less than its title suggests. . . . The book provides a survey of the social history of Britain&#x2019;s plantation complex that is as much about culture as economics.&#x201d; (<i>Early American Literature</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Planters, Merchants, and Slaves</i> is a masterful synthesis of decades of scholarship on the development of plantation societies, integrating original research on the immense wealth created, the relationship of those societies to nonplantation sectors, the extreme violence required to sustain them, and the reasons for their eventual collapse, despite their continuing profitability, from forces arising outside the system. Anyone interested in the significance of slavery and the plantation system for the rise of early modern capitalism; patterns of social, political, and economic development in slave societies; or the widespread violence required to sustain that system will find much to admire in this insightful contribution to Atlantic World history.&#x201d; (<i>New West Indian Guide</i>)</p><h2>C++ How to Program: Late Objects Version (How to Program (Deitel))</h2><p><p> <i>Late Objects Version: C++ How to Program, 7/e</i> is ideal for Introduction to Programming (CS1) and other more intermediate courses covering programming in C++.

Professor Danziger considers methodology as a kind of social practice rather than being simply a matter of technique. Therefore his historical analysis is primarily concerned with such topics as the development of the social structure of the research relationship between experimenters and their subjects, as well as the role of methodology in the relationship of investigators to each other and to a wider social context. Another major theme addresses the relationship between the social practice of research and the nature of the product that is the outcome of this practice.</p><p>Considering methodology as a kind of social practice rather than being simply a matter of technique, this book traces the history of psychological research methodology from the nineteenth century to the emergence of currently favored styles of research."Danziger is to be commended for his incisive and compelling archeology of investigative practices.

Speaking in defence of the young aristocrat Marcus Caelius Rufus on charges of political violence, Cicero scores his points with wit but also with searing invective directed at a supporter of the prosecution, Clodia Metelli, whom he represents as seeking vengeance as a lover spurned by his client. This new edition and detailed commentary offers advanced undergraduates and graduate students, as well as scholars, a detailed analysis of Cicero&#39;s rhetorical strategies and stylistic refinements and presents a systematic account of the background and significance of the speech, including in-depth explanations of Roman court proceedings.</p><p>New edition of and detailed commentary on what is perhaps Cicero&#39;s best-loved speech.

Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action. In this book, Paul Dourish addresses the philosophical bases of human-computer interaction. He looks at how what he calls "embodied interaction"&#x2015;an approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationality&#x2015;reflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.</p></p><p>Paul Dourish is Chancellor's Professor of Informatics in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. He is the author of<i> Where the Action Is: The Foundations of Embodied Interaction </i>and coauthor of <i>Divining a Digital Future: Mess and Mythology in Ubiquitous Computing</i>, both published by the MIT Press.<p>Human-computer interaction meets philosophical treatments of embodiment. The result: a foundational study of living and acting in a wired world. And a rare achievement too: a readable and engaging book which manages to be both sensible and groundbreaking at the same time.</p>&#x2015;<b>Andy Clark</b>, Department of Philosophy, University of Edinburgh<br><br><p>A revolution in design and the role of computer science is upon us: Where the Action Is describes the way. In the old days, the focus was upon the technology and 'computing,' hence the interest is the interface between humans and machines&#x2015;us versus them. Not anymore. As Dourish so cogently explains, design should not be about tasks and their requirements, or applications, or computing&#x2015;design is really about interaction, with a focus on ubiquity, tangibility, and most of all, shared awareness, intimacy, and emotions. This is a revolution badly needed: It's about time.</p>&#x2015;<b>Donald A. Norman</b>, Norman Nielsen Group and UNext Learning Services, author of <i>The Invisible Computer</i><br><br><p><i>Where the Action Is</i> provides intellectual foundations for the emerging movement that makes people, and not machines, central to the process of design. With a clarity and thoughtfulness that make hard ideas easy, Paul Dourish's book will only increase in importance as the social nature of computing becomes evident to a new generation of technologists.</p>&#x2015;<b>Philip E. Agre</b>, Department of Information Studies, University of California, Los Angeles<br><br><p>In this beautifully written book, Paul Dourish synthesizes conceptual resources drawn from across the humanities, social and computing sciences, in a way that is generative for our thinking about human/artifact relations. He surveys an intellectual terrain that provides both theoretical and practical support for new forms of engagement across the disciplines, and with the objects of creative technical practice. This book will be a resource not only for designers in human-computer interaction and computer-supported cooperative work but also for scholars of science and technology interested in understanding those worlds from a deeply insightful, reflective practitioner's point of view.</p>&#x2015;<b>Lucy Suchman</b>, Professor, Centre for Science Studies, Lancaster University<br><br><p>This is the first book to provide a broad view of how our interaction with computers is intertwined with our physical world. Dourish gives a wealth of examples of innovations in computer technologies, along with a deep grounding in the philosophical, psychological, and sociological issues and theories. The book is unique in combining great breadth of intellectual underpinnings with a clear explanation that elucidates the relationships between the fields without falling prey to the jargon of either. Everyone interested in seeing where computer interaction is leading us in the coming century will benefit from the wide view and clear perspective that Dourish presents.</p>&#x2015;<b>Terry Winograd</b>, Professor of Computer Science, Stanford University</p><h2>Philosophy of Social Science: A New Introduction</h2><p>This is a much-needed new introduction to a field that has been transformed in recent years by exciting new subjects, ideas, and methods. It is designed both for students with central interests in philosophy and those planning to concentrate on the social sciences, and it presupposes no particular background in either domain. From the wide range of topics at the forefront of debate in philosophy of social science, the editors have chosen those which are representative of the most important and interesting contemporary work. A team of distinguished experts explore key aspects of the field such as social ontology (what are the things that social science studies?), objectivity, formal methods, measurement, and causal inference. Also included are chapters focused on notable subjects of social science research, such as well-being and climate change. <em>Philosophy of Social Science</em> provides a clear, accessible, and up-to-date guide to this fascinating field.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nancy Cartwright</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at the Department of Philosophy, University of Durham and at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).

Similarly, the essays are valuable for students in the social sciences, who likely will find them liberating in contrast to some conceptions of the natural sciences that are oversimplified but often still influential. The wide-ranging topics addressed in this volume include currently charged issues regarding climate science and demands for evidence-based public policy and equally charged but long-standing concerns about objectivity and the role of values in science. The essays on these topics, and other essays on matters such as case studies, measurement, and causal analysis, will broaden and deepen readers' understanding of science... Recommended. Lower-level undergraduates through graduate students; general readers." --<em>Choice</em> <br><p></p><br>"...the book showcases contributions by experts who provide an introduction to their area of competence with an accessible and fresh style. The result is sixteen chapters about debates of major concern to the philosophers of social science, which, while providing some background knowledge of the specific subject, often do so by giving it a novel or original twist. Overall, the style and structure of the book seem designed more to raise the curiosity of those new to the field than to systematically inform about the current state of affairs in the philosophy of the social sciences. In so doing, the book distances itself to some extent from other similar manuals, aspires to interest a broad and diverse audience, and qualifies as a good teaching resource." -- <em>Metascience</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Social Vulnerability to Disasters</h2><p><p>The 2010 Haiti and Chili earthquakes, the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and the 2011 Fukushima earthquake and tsunami in Japan are but a few examples of recent catastrophic events that continue to reveal how social structure and roles produce extensive human suffering and differential impacts on individuals and communities. These events bring social vulnerability to the forefront in considering how disasters unfold, clearly revealing that disasters are not created from the physical event alone. Equally important, people&#x2015;even those considered vulnerable&#x2015;respond in innovative and resilient ways that unveil the strength of human ingenuity and spirit. It is not a foregone conclusion that a hazard event, even a large one, will result in catastrophic loss. </p> <p></p> <p>This updated second edition of <b>Social Vulnerability to Disasters</b> focuses on the social construction of disasters, demonstrating how the characteristics of an event are not the only reason that tragedies unfurl. By carefully examining and documenting social vulnerabilities throughout the disaster management cycle, the book remains essential to emergency management professionals, the independent volunteer sector, homeland security, and related social science fields, including public policy, sociology, geography, political science, urban and regional planning, and public health. The new edition is fully updated, more international in scope, and incorporates significant recent disaster events. It also includes new case studies to illustrate important concepts. </p> <p></p> <p>By understanding the nuances of social vulnerability and how these vulnerabilities compound one another, we can take steps to reduce the danger to at-risk populations and strengthen community resilience overall. </p> <p></p> <p>Features and Highlights from the <b>Second Edition</b>:</p> <ul> <p> </p><li>Contains contributions from leading scholars, professionals, and academics, who draw on their areas of expertise to examine vulnerable populations </li> <li>Incorporates disaster case studies to illustrate concepts, relevant and seminal literature, and the most recent data available </li> <li>In addition to highlighting the U.S. context, integrates a global approach and includes numerous international case studies </li> <li>Highlights recent policy changes and current disaster management approaches</li> <li>Infuses the concept of community resilience and building capacity throughout the text</li> <li>Includes new chapters that incorporate additional perspectives on social vulnerability</li> <li><i><strong>Instructor&#x2019;s guide, PowerPoint� slides, and test bank available with qualifying course adoption</strong></i></li></ul></p><p><strong>Deborah S.K.

Writing his letter to the Galatians in the midst of that struggle, Paul was concerned to find a way by which he could assert the radical newness of God&#x2019;s act in Christ while still affirming the positive relation of that act to the solemn promise God had made centuries earlier to Abraham.<br>With the skill of a seasoned scholar and teacher, J. Louis Martyn enables us to take imaginary seats in the Galatian churches so that we may hear Paul&#x2019;s words with the ears of the early Christians themselves. Listening in this manner, we begin to sense the dramatic intensity of the theological struggle, thus coming to understand the crucial distinctions between the theology of Paul and that of his opponents. We can therefore see why Galatians proved to be a momentous turning point in early Christianity: In this letter Paul preached the decisive and liberating newness of Christ while avoiding both the distortions of anti-Judaism and his opponents&#x2019; reduction of Christ to a mere episode in the epic of Israel&#x2019;s history. Like the Galatians of Paul&#x2019;s day, we can begin to hear what the apostle himself called &#x201c;the truth of the gospel.&#x201d;</p>As its predecessors in the Anchor Bible series have done <i>Galatians</i> successfully makes available all the significant historical and linguistic knowledge which bears on the interpretation of this important New Testament book. A personal letter written by Paul in the mid-first century to friends in the churches emerging in the region of Galatia, where it was circulated, Galatians is down to earth and pragmatic. This biblical book requires the modern reader to take a seat in one of the Galatian congregations, to listen to Paul's letter with Galatian ears, and discern the contours of Paul's theology. That is exactly what Dr. Martyn makes possible in his marvelous commentary, with its careful translation and creative interpretation of Galatians. Though relatively brief, Paul's letter is filled with complex theological and historical issues that demand a thorough treatment. Readers will not be disappointed in Dr. Martyn's sensitive handling of difficult passages, and all will be delighted to have a fresh translation that makes sense to our modern ears.

More recently, it has also become a cause c�l�bre for pundits and civic-minded citizens wanting to improve the health of American democracy. But only recently have scholars begun empirical investigations of where and with what consequences people interact with those whose political views differ from their own. Hearing the Other Side examines this theme in the context of the contemporary United States. It is unique in its effort to link political theory with empirical research. Drawing on her empirical work, Mutz suggests that it is doubtful that an extremely activist political culture can also be a heavily deliberative one.</p><p>Examines the consequences - both positive and negative - of living in mixed political company.

The series centers on Martin Heidegger and the enigmatic German word <i>Geschlecht</i>, which has several meanings pointing to race, sex, and lineage. Throughout the series, Derrida engages with Heidegger&#x2019;s controversial oeuvre to tease out topics of sexual difference, nationalism, race, and humanity. In Geschlecht III, he calls attention to Heidegger&#x2019;s problematic nationalism, his work&#x2019;s political and sexual themes, and his promise of salvation through the coming of the &#x201c;One <i>Geschlecht</i>,&#x201d; a sentiment that Derrida found concerningly close to the racial ideology of the Nazi party.<br><br> Amid new revelations about Heidegger&#x2019;s anti-Semitism and the contemporary context of nationalist resurgence, this third piece of the <i>Geschlecht </i>series is timelier and more necessary than ever.

Transcending relativism/ universalism debates that reduce feminism to a Western notion, Serene J. Khader proposes a feminist vision that is sensitive to postcolonial and antiracist concerns. Khader criticizes the false universalism of what she calls 'Enlightenment liberalism,' a worldview according to which the West is the one true exemplar of gender justice and moral progress is best achieved through economic independence and the abandonment of tradition. She argues that anti-imperialist feminists must rediscover the normative core of feminism and rethink the role of moral ideals in transnational feminist praxis. What emerges is a nonideal universalism that rejects missionary feminisms that treat Western intervention and the spread of Enlightenment liberalism as the path to global gender injustice.<br><br>The book draws on evidence from transnational women's movements and development practice in addition to arguments from political philosophy and postcolonial and decolonial theory, offering a rich moral vision for twenty-first century feminism.<br></p><p><br><strong>Serene J. Khader</strong> is Associate Professor of Philosophy and Women's and Gender Studies at the CUNY Graduate Center and Jay Newman Chair in Philosophy of Culture at Brooklyn College. She is the also the author of <em>Adaptive Preferences and Women's Empowerment </em>and co-editor, with Ann Garry and Alison Stone, of <em>The Routledge Companion to Feminist Philosophy.</em><br><br>"Khader demonstrates that if Western liberals are to have something to offer the women of the Global South, they must acknowledge a higher burden of justification than is typically supposed. Khader's book also illuminates an important general lesson about injustice, namely that piecemeal attempts to fix some part of an oppressive structure will fail unless attention is paid to the rest of that structure, the explanations for its existence, and which of its parts might need to be preserved even if other cultures find them hard to swallow. As Khader notes, 'the tragedy � is that feminist change is typically going to require changes to relationships women are genuinely self-interestedly invested in'. In bringing these complexities to light and showing how they might change our approach, Khader has produced a pioneering work." -- Daniel Halliday, <em>Australian Book Review </em><p></p><br>"The book draws on evidence from transnational women's movements and development practice in addition to arguments from political philosophy and postcolonial and decolonial theory, offering a rich moral vision for twenty-first century feminism." -- <em>Allegra Lab</em><p></p><br>"scholarly and conceptually rigorous, this work of theoretical feminist philosophy shines ... Highly recommended." -- P. W. Wakefield, <em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"This is the book that we have been waiting for. Serene Khader explains how to be an anti-imperialist feminist without retreating from judgment or attempting to stay 'local.' Careful and balanced but powerfully argued, this is an absolute must for everyone concerned about gender-based oppression around the world."--Linda Mart�n Alcoff, Hunter College and the Graduate Center, CUNY<p></p><br>"This is an important and timely book. Khader argues that we can identify what is wrong in sexist oppression without thereby committing ourselves to a singular blueprint for what is right. In doing so, she offers a compelling way out of a current feminist impasse, one that has been particularly pressing for a transnational feminism seeking to avoid the universalising imposition of one cultural narrative. Her argument about the transition costs of challenging oppression is especially persuasive, as is her critique of 'independence individualism,' and the book combines rigorous philosophical argument with carefully contextualised examples."--Anne Phillips, London School of Economics and Political Science<p></p><br>"Khader's incisive analysis of the dark side of Western values long associated with feminism individualism, secularism, and 'gender role eliminativism' provides an utterly compelling roadmap for decolonizing feminist thinking and practice. Reconceiving feminism as opposition to sexist oppression, Khader shows that a transnational feminist praxis with normative and political bite is possible, but must respectfully engage the diverse values, roles, and arrangements of women around the world. This is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand why the global feminist revolution didn't happen, but might yet."--Monique Deveaux, University of Guelph<p></p><br></p><h2>Medical Physiology: The Big Picture (LANGE The Big Picture)</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Get the BIG PICTURE of Medical Physiology -- and focus on what you <i>really</i> need to know to ace the course and board exams!</b><br></p><p><b>4-Star Doody's Review!</b><br>"This excellent, no-frills approach to physiology concepts is designed to help medical students and other health professions students review the basic concepts associated with physiology for the medical profession.

Within a hundred years both of these kingdoms had been thrown into chaos by the onslaught of the Vikings and within two hundred years they had become distant memories. This book charts the transformation of the political landscape of northern Britain between the eighth and the eleventh centuries. Central to this narrative is the mysterious disappearance of the Picts and their language and the sudden rise to prominence of the Gaelic-speaking Scots who would replace them as the rulers of the North. <em>From Pictland to Alba</em> uses fragmentary sources which survive from this darkest period in Scottish history to guide the reader past the pitfalls which beset the unwary traveller in these dangerous times. Important sources are presented in full and their value as evidence is thoroughly explored and evaluated.<br></p><p><br>Alex Woolf is Lecturer in Early Scottish History at the University of St Andrews<br><p>This book deserves to become a recommended text.</p> (Alasdair Ross <i>H-Albion</i>)<br><br><p>A detailed study of a critical period in Scottish history...
